       "['✅ Trip Verified |  The lounge is clean but the seats are worn, and there is not enough space to accommodate all the passengers travelling in Club and those with silver and having access to the lounge. Nothing wrong, decent sandwiches but no hot food only soup, decent choice of alcoholic beverages and acceptable wines. Service with a smile. vOnly a shame the restrooms are extremely basic and not very clean.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The lounge is very spacious with a wide variety of areas to sit and a kids play area. Food was amazing with hot cooked foods at breakfast. Alcoholic beverages were limited to wine / sparking wine as it was morning. Very clean and showers are available, which was great after connecting from an overnight flight from New York. Staff were welcoming and friendly.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Tatty and uncared for, the BA business lounge in Gatwick South Terminal seems to be unloved and uncared for. The staff try hard but there is little loyalty (they do not work for BA) Information on flights is scarce due to them not working direct and on one occasion they were told by BA to “stop bothering them” when they were trying to ascertain the status of a much delayed flight. Despite the flight having been delayed for over five hours the customers were kicked out of the lounge two hours before boarding as it was closing. I would certainly never fly with this truly rotten and totally incompetent airline again.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Crowded or rather \"overcrowded\" as usual. The catering staff in the lounge are nice, polite and helpful - in contrast to the reception BA staff who are rude, abrasive and have no right to be facing customers. The toilets are terrible, long queues to access one, no urinals so all men have to queue up for the single toilets. As with so many other parts of the famous BA cost-cutting, all magazines and newspapers have not been returned after Covid, and this is now a further drop in standards. Food is okay, but hot food is real canteen style and not a match on many airlines first class standards. To call this a \"First\" lounge is a disgrace, and you are probably better off going to one of the restaurants in the main departure hall. And one thing you will note, Heathrow public toilets are nicer and kept cleaner than the BA lounge facilities. ',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Flew London to Kalamata and as a Silver/Saphire member used the Galleries South Lounge. COVID had meant that food offerings had been stripped back to a bare minimum, but I am pleased that a full service has been resumed. Quite busy but found two comfortable seats easily enough. Had a decent full English breakfast with a glass of champagne and very good cup or two of coffee. Much better, BA.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  We were at The British Airways Terminal 5 South Business Lounge at Heathrow Airport on the evening of April 24, 2023. We were shocked to see not one but three mice running under and around our chairs and table. The wait staff told me the lounge is infested with mice and that British Airways and Heathrow Airport have known about this for months. I was so disgusted that I left. I was then told by a flight attendant that their crew lounge is also infested with mice. Lastly, I was told by an airport meet and greet that the problem is not just limited to the British Air lounges. In addition to the active mice, the lounge was very dark, the tables were dirty as was the glassware. Totally disgusting and unacceptable. The health department needs to close the lounge in my opinion.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |\\xa0\\xa0A pretty underwhelming experience. The staff on the desk to greet us were quite cold and unwelcoming. The same was true of the staff on the baggage storage desk and the shower suite desk. The shower facilities were in desperate need of refurbishment. As is the lounge in general. The food on offer was quite nice and the atmosphere was quiet and relaxed which is what we needed after a very long flight. Bottom line though is BA really need to improve the quality of their staff and give this particular lounge a refresh.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled on a weekend which I never normally do, so was taken aback by how busy the lounge was. I did find a decent seat luckily, and tried from both the breakfast and lunch menu. Both offered a decent selection of nice food and beverages. On the wine side a really ordinary Prosecco was available to self serve but you needed to order champagne. I did find a really good Sauvignon which exceeded my expectations and only wish that happened more. The staff were very good at keeping a really busy lounge not looking too distressed with the volume of customers. Generally not a bad experience but hardly outstanding, I guess you need to head to the Gulf States for that.',\n",
       " \"Not Verified |  Arrived from Johannesburg and went to the Concorde Room for breakfast. Thirty minutes after ordering nothing arrived, apparently order lost between the dining area and the kitchen. Lounge not busy so no excuse for this shoddy level of service. It was a chaotic shambles, and given that this is BA's flagship lounge it was extremely disappointing. I eventually went to the First lounge and had breakfast there. The staff in the Concorde lounge really need a refresher course, there is no excuse for getting something so straightforward wrong.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  BA Business Class ticket holders access Escape Lounge, which is also a pay per use lounge. Compared with BA’s lounges around the world, this is as basic as it gets. Self service hot and cold snacks, soft drinks and tea/coffee. Alcohol on request from the bar. The wines are cheap and don’t compare to business class offerings at BA. Lounge is tidy. There’s a waste trolley on view where staff scrape dirty plates into the bin and stack dirty plates. Very off putting. Staff like to chat amongst themselves. The ‘meet and greet’ person on the lounge was glued to her chair and social media, shouting ‘Hiya’ and ‘See Ya’ every now and again. The lounge is a nice escape from the crowds downstairs with lots of charging points for devices.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Only a few USB ports are working. Food offerings were better than before. Drink choices have been limited to minimalist. No more Zacapa rum or Woodford Reserve. Not even Jack Daniels if u don’t like Bulleit Bourbon. That includes onboard. Packed lounge with sun boiling anyone sitting in its way as there’s no window shading. Staff were working hard I felt given the amount of people. Bottled water removed. Shame as it was handy. Only tiny 250ml beer cans available. No Tiger or Amstel choices…',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Having paid BA over £7000 for our trip to Barbados we rather thought we might be able to get some breakfast before boarding. We tried a very overcrowded lounge soon after security and managed a small plate of baked beans. Toast and bacon were not on offer. A member of the lounge staff tipped us off that the business lounge in C satellite would be more comfortable so we went there. Much less crowded but the same lack of breakfast on offer.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The food was surprisingly good. Back to self service breakfast and lunch. Plenty of drinks selection but sadly no more Gentleman Jack or Woodford Reserve. Also no Zacapa rum which is  disappointing. Bulleit bourbon is simply awful. For a Saturday afternoon, there was plenty of seats. Staff all very polite and friendly.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Others have reviewed this quite harshly. Our experience could not have been better. In fact this is one of the best lounges we have visited and we have been to many other business lounges. Its nearly up there with Istanbul and Singapore. Very well laid out, with plenty of space and places to sit/eat. The choice and variety of food was excellent. We arrived just at the breakfast/ lunch changeover. So, we had a pretty great choice!! This lounge is in total contrast to the Swiss Business lounge at Zurich which we visited the day before that was just pathetic.  A very good lounge.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  Way too crowded with many people walking around looking for a place to sit. No champagne at the champagne bar (although a staff member did bring a tray of filled glasses after mentioning that passengers were walking off with the bottles!) BA used to have a display in the terminal showing how crowded each of the T5 lounges were, but that wasn't visible this time. Staff were trying valiantly, but the number of people was simply too much for them to do more than the bare minimum of clearing glasses and dishes. Next time I think I'll just have a glass of champagne and some nice oysters outside - even if I have to pay, it will definitely be more comfortable and less stressful.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Awful experience. Overcrowded, inedible food, disgusting toilets. We left almost immediately and went to sit in the Terminal. BA should be ashamed of this facility.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The British Airways Lounge is excellent. I had a nice cream tea, though I avoided the tea and had strawberry Baileys instead, the scone was excellent the clotted cream great and the strawberry jam nice, after that I went through to the rest area where high-tech seats are available but I have a 20 minute limit, however since there were very few people waiting I just used another and another 20 minutes with no problem, Disadvantages of the BA lounge were that there were very few charging points available beside the seats in the rest area there was a charging point but elsewhere they were few and far between, The drink selection was good apart from a rather unusual absence of cognac Armagnac or brandy, however the strawberry Baileys and birthday cake Baileys along with a wide selection of other choices made up for the missing Brandy. The food was excellent. ',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Terminal 5B lounge is so much better than the T5A lounge. Nice and quiet. It is worth the train and walk back to the main terminal. The lounge at T5A is huge and quite impersonal.',\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  Not British Airways best. Very badly laid out lounge, limited facilities and no views. However, staff very nice. The terminal is being rebuilt so hopefully this will improve.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Used on Wednesday 16 March before our flight to Barbados. Busy but could still find a comfortable seat, and a reasonable selection of drinks on offer. Coffee machines working this time (most were not November 2021), and very good coffee it was. Unfortunately and as I suspected in November 2021 the food offering has further declined: the hot offering was just a Bacon Roll only this time without even hash browns. A couple of nice pastries on offer. It is clear that BA are now using COVID as the excuse to downgrade their offerings and cost cut. What used to be a very nice lounge with a decent buffet breakfast selection has now gone for good, I fear.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  Well organised lounge. Light, airy and decent food. Food was pretty good and coffee was excellent as you'd expect in Italy. Not so sure it'd be the best for a long stop but great for short.\",\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  Possibly the worst lounge with the most miserable staff. Many people haven't flown for a long time and lounges methods have changed. Poor food. Rude staff and disgusting toilets.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Nice views of the runway in one section but very crowded and thus uncomfortable. Good selection of drinks but their app system of ordering food (no buffet) means that when it gets delivered to your table means it is cold. Weird setup in there and certainly not conducive to a relaxed wait for your flight. I am sure that BA can do better, stressed passengers do not deal with the inevitable delayed flight as well as relaxed ones.',\n",
       " 'Not Verified | The lounge has been refurbished since my last visit but difficult to see any major changes. However, very pleasant and fantastically helpful staff - full marks to them!',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Used this Lounge on 5th November before our flight to Tenerife. Still a reasonably comfortable place to wait for your flight with a good selection of drinks. However, since COVID-19 the standard of the food offering has declined dramatically with just a Bacon Roll and Hash Browns as the main hot offering. Food also has to be ordered by a Lounge App and you will be served at your table. At least 2 of the coffee machines were not working and causing problems. No longer a real Premium offering - one can only hope that when COVID eventually dies down the lounge can return to its former decent buffet. But I\\'m not holding my breath - BA may just use this as an excuse to become the new \"normal\" lounge service.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the first time using this Terminal 5 lounge after recently becoming a British Airways Executive Club Gold Member. I was travelling on an Economy Hand Baggage only flight with a non status friend and he was allowed to enter as my guest. There isn't a huge difference between the Business and the First Class lounge. You still have the British Airways, NHS style Showers and Toilets. Furnishings that aren't too modern and the lack of that truly luxurious feel. But, There is an upgrade in the drinks variety. More premium brands of drinks. This visit was during Covid and so you had to order food and snacks by scanning a QR code, entering your table number and placing your order. BA lounges have never been truly luxurious, If you have one world status you are better off visiting the likes of Cathay Pacific whose bathrooms are beautifully designed, tiled and contain Aesop products. But if you want an English Breakfast for instance. BA is your best bet.\",\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  I visited this lounge in March when travel reduced because of the virus. This lounge is used by Aer Lingus and other OneWorld Elites which make this lounge crowded, especially in the evening. The snack options in the lounge are decent and something you can work with. This lounge has no windows and very low ceilings which make it gloomy. Club Dining is a nice option and highly recommended, it's less crowded than the rest of the lounge because of restricted access and a good choice of hot food in response to BA's sleeper service.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  This American Airlines Admirals Club lounge was very basic with limited food and drink options, plenty of different seating areas but it was a real let down and not worth using in my opinion. I expected more but would advise just sitting in main terminal and paying for some food, I am surprised this is an American Airlines Lounge but they must be easily pleased. Would not bother using or even go to the bother of finding the lounge. If you just want a drink and a cracker then you will love it. Total waste of time,',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  I used the Terminal 5 North Lounge as I find this lounge less busy. Plenty of seats today so no problems for me. Food was very hit and miss, some strange bread Rolls with Bacon, they were heavily seeded and strange, not to my liking what is wrong with plain?  Plenty of hot, cold and soft drinks as well as the usual alcohol.  Today's use of lounge was fine a bit busier as the morning went on, toilets needed cleaning.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The lounge is divided into business and first and has been renovated. Late evening the Club World lounge was quiet. Plentiful seating, decent selection of drinks. I found the F & B is nowhere near the standards of AA with their Flagship lounge or other One World ones I most often use. Maybe it was later in the evening but quality felt lacking. The ambience was very flat. Terminal 7 at JFK is the BA terminal and whilst great for BA and its One World partners to have its own space, its a very tired terminal. Washrooms are still the same cramped space and the showers clearly have not been renovated.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The Galleries First lounge at Heathrow was beautiful and calm. Place to relax or work a bit between your flights. Excellent service all over. Nothing much more you can ask for even with a first class ticket price.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The Concorde Lounge is a place to relax and a place to eat. Superb service and good space. You can sit inside the lounge or the area outside above the departure hall if you like some more buzz. Nice dining area and good food. Only downside is there are a little short of bathrooms.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The Club World and First Galleries Lounge at Johannesburg has been the subject of much needed refurbishment and reflects a new harmonised policy for housing both classes under one roof without as overt a distinction as before. To be honest, the previous First lounge was something of an embarrassment, with too few seats and general feeling of being cramped. The new arrangement eschews a separate First lounge but allocates a separate First dining area. This seems to work reasonably well. The rest of the lounge is by no means spacious but there are adequate seats to accommodation the Club and First passengers on the two evening flights to LHR. The food seems to substantially better than before, with regular refreshes of both hot and cold food. The bar area is spacious as bar areas go and service was good. Overall, the new Galleries Lounge is a definite improvement for Club passengers; First passengers may not agree, of course.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  After a subpar visit to the Qantas Lounge next door, my partner and I decided to give the British Airways Lounge a go. It was a completely different experience, a much better one in my opinion. The space had such character with striking decors along with a great layout for dining, work and relaxation. The catering was fantastic with plenty of options for food and beverages with plenty of comfortable seating to enjoy it. Customer service was average, lounge team were present and making sure food was plentiful plus consistently tidying but lack face to face service. Shower facilities were adequate but lacked in numbers. Overall, a great visit as I would definitely pick this lounge over the Qantas and third party offerings.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Main Galleries Lounge in Terminal 5 at Heathrow was very busy. Food options were very good and plentiful. The main Lounge A-Gates, as usual, were very busy, not helped when some of the U shaped seating areas have massive square tables making it difficult for people to get seated (very bad design) We had a C-Gate departure so left the lounge and went to the quieter Lounge in the B-gate area which I would always recommend people to do.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  Cathay Pacific uses this lounge for their Washington flights to HKG. The lounge is nice but most sections were shut as it is 11pm at night. There was no hot food apart from soup and there are  sandwiches on offer and lots of fresh fruit. The usual tea and coffee and white and red wine plus a few beers.  If you plan to dine before you fly so you can catch maximum sleep on the plane, don't plan on doing it in this lounge which is miserable. The toilets were not clean with paper towels everywhere. The staff were pleasant enough. CX needs to do something about their lounge access in IAD.\",\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  The BA lounge at Newark Airport is very nicely appointed with good food (the steak and ale pie on offer that evening was delicious) and plenty of seating throughout. The female toilets were also spotlessly clean and tidy. I was very happy to see Rosa there again, this staff member and all the team work very hard to keep customers happy.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  I used the business lounge \"south\" on Heathrow T5 and as usual it was rather busy. Plenty of newspapers , magazines and books available to read and decent internet. There is plenty of food, pastries and chocolates, fruits and yoghurts. Also bread filled with bacon, however no cheese or ham available - jams and marmalade out of big tins. Ample choice of teas and coffee. Also - despite it was rather early - lots of wines and alcoholic beverages (even better brands like Grey Goose) and sodas. There is a lot to eat and to drink, only a shame the food is not refined.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Really looking forward to the New Airport opening. The old lounge is very odd, at least you no longer have to ring the bell to get in but you do have to knock on the door. It is rather small and the offerings are miserable just a few sandwiches on a plate( total 12 cut quarters at a time) a selection of cheese, crisps and some fruit, a strange man (always the same one) who wanders around and refills. you have a selection of drinks and a few TV screens. Not what you expect from a Club Lounge but it has always been the same. Toilets ok, again limited, Roll on 2020.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Plenty of space and lots of seats to choose at the Gatwick Club World Lounge, the food selections (it was lunchtime 12:30) were very good. Not the usual finger treats and a few sandwiches but a good selection of Chilli meatballs, chicken stew with beans, baked potatoes, rice (cooked very well) and the sandwiches and nibbles. I was absolutely full and thoroughly enjoyed my stay ion the lounge. Toilets and showers were all clean and tidy. For once a very pleasant stay. WiFi worked well.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  BA Business Class passengers share a lounge with Priority Pass customers and several other airlines. The lounge itself was extremely busy but there's a cordoned off area at one end for BA passengers which is dark and cramped. However, when we arrived two hours before our flight there were no seats. We had to wait until other passengers left. The food was poor - a couple of types of wrap and some crispy egg sandwiches on rye plus soup and a tired tray of salad ingredients. We discovered subsequently that the food in the main area was fresher - probably due to the high number of people.The only nibbles were wasabi peas, stale pretzels and a variety of different sweets. There's a bar in the main area but the wine wasn't properly chilled. The free wifi was open but quick. We were extremely disappointed with this lounge as Atlanta is a major hub and we were hoping to get dinner there so we could sleep on our flight.\",\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  This is not a British Airways lounge but a third party Airport Lounge that BA uses for their passengers. The lounge is small, full of people and not comfortable at all. There was almost not food and just drinks however selection of drinks was really poor. Overwhelming noisy making impossible to relax before a flight. Staff was rude, useless and they were clearly upset as we don't speak German and had to talk to us in English.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Appalling lounge in Terminal 3. Food mediocre at best  and no gluten free options. Not enough easy chairs so had to sit on a stool. Dreary and depressing decor. Will try a different airline.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  This lounge opened at Logan last year after a bit of a revamp of Terminal E. It caters for First, Business and Silver/ Gold passengers (I accessed using the latter). Despite flying on the first evening service of the day, the lounge wasn't busy, and it's very spacious. There's a view of the apron from the far end with large windows and bar style seating next to them. Near the entrance is the usual self service bar and snacks, similar to the BA Galleries lounges in Heathrow and Gatwick. Down the far end, however, is a full service bar. The staff there were fantastic, and constantly brought me over another drink as soon as they saw my glass was empty. Pre flight dining is available from 5pm from a buffet, which had a good selection and the food was nice. There's also a Concorde dining area for F passengers. The real bonus with this lounge is that you board the aircraft directly from the lounge, which is positioned above the boarding gate. The staff were all fantastic, so friendly and obliging. This is quite possibly the best BA lounge I've experienced - I'd easily rate it above the flagship Concorde Room! It's that good!\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The Galleries First lounge is little more than a corridor next to the Club World lounge. There are adequate seats for the small number of BA flights leaving JNB at night. Food is self-service and includes a fair selection of hot and cold options. Drinks are limited in choice and champagne is Larssen rather than Laurent Perrier. Unfortunately, because of the compact size of the space, loud transatlantic smartphone conversations can easily disturb the peace.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Approached staff to ask if it would be possible to use the lounge for an hour prior to my connecting flight to Scotland after travelling from the US. I understood that I would be potentially charged, but nevertheless asked if I could use it for free. I was  turned away and not even offered any use of the facilities even if I had to pay. I think that this is absolutely disgusting, considering the respect and gratitude offered and given to me by American Airlines, including speedy boarding given to military. ',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Menzies Aurora Lounge used by British Airways. One word: Worthless. Could be a hotel foyer or something. Not what you expect with a business class fares!',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  Very attentive staff but the lounge needs a touch up badly. Furniture looks like it's from the 80th. Selection of drinks, food and coffee was quite average. Had breakfast before a flight and the scrambled eggs gets 5 stars! Champagne served was really mediocre and not first class standard. But not having towels in the bathroom makes them like any bathroom in the terminal. They have those awful hand blow dryers. Re-do and do it right British Airways.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The lounge itself is not too bad except for the quality of the light: no natural light and really bad artificial light. The really unacceptable thing is the music level, really too high! And also the music selection, it was all about 80’ hits. This is really far from relaxing or working time. I had to spend 3 hours and I asked at least 4 times to the attendants to do something but without success.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  As Business Class lounges go this one is pretty poor. For a flight with 72+ Business Class seats there is barely enough space for this many people and certainly not comfortably. It's cramped and faces the evening sun so very warm. The choice of 'food' is very minimal. The bar is served through a hatch with a queue every time for a drink and a limited selection. There are less bathrooms in this lounge than on the aircraft so time your visit carefully.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The lounge in Changi airport are pretty spacious. Considering that there are consecutively two flights (by 777 and A380) departing to London within 30 minutes, however, the lounge was not as crowded as I expected. There were a wide selection of drinks and alcohol but the choice for food was a bit limited: only three kinds of main dish with pasta and mashed potato. The staff here were nice with great hospitality.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  I went to the Heathrow T5 arrival lounge for showering and breakfast after a 14 hours long flight from Singapore. The lounge located right after custom clearance and it's very easy to find. The reception staff were very hospitable but the lady staff in charge of assigning shower rooms was a bit inpatient. The food was nice and there were a lot of choices for breakfast. In general it was a very refreshing experience.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Lounge feels very cold and impersonal, Not very organised, by the time you find anything it’s time to go. I am sure the staff are wonderful, however, I feel they have to much work not enough workers to keep up. Food unfortunately is nothing special! The Bars are far apart, again nothing to write home about. Also upon entering the lounge I was not told the WIFI password so I will not rate that. Asked if my friend could possibly pay to get in and was told it is an invite (I get it) but what do you pay these extortionate prices for? Maybe get hold of the British airways lounge in Singapore and get some ideas from them and also they are so much more friendly, a nice smile goes along way! I have been asked if I would recommend the airline - airline yes the lounge in London Heathrow “No”',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely rammed. I used to be Emerald with one world until two years ago when I changed alliances. First Class lounge at Heathrow is probably my favourite in the world, it was hard to make the decision to lose that. I don't think I have been in the business class lounge at T5 for 5 years but it has deteriorated. There were people lying across sofas as one would see in a bus station, the place looked dishevelled, it really looked like a pay to enter lounge. I did not have time to sample the food on offer but BA normally has decent food and the drinks selection was good. BA needs to think about either making more space available for frequent travellers or lifting the number of tier points to achieve Sapphire status because this lounge is simply no longer a pleasant environment to spend any significant period of time.\",\n",
       " \"Not Verified |  Used BA's Club and First Lounge. Got there early as 2 BA flights that day about 3 hours apart so was reasonably busy. Found 2 comfortable seats in a quiet corner without any problem. Good choice of beverages - beers, wines and spirits - and had a glass of Prosecco brought to us. Very nice helpful staff who cleared up tables and refreshed the rather limited food options frequently. In common with most North American lounges the food options for Business passengers was limited to 3 types of sandwiches, vegetarian wraps, potato crisps nuts and two types of cheese cut into squares. No hot/cooked choices. Notwithstanding the limited choice of food it was a comfortable and quiet enough place to while away a couple of hours before the flight.\",\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  Flew from LHR Saturday 7th July and used the T5 Galleries Lounge (North, I think). Plenty of room, not too crowded and easy to find comfy seats for my wife and I. Actually quite a good choice of hot and cold breakfast food so indulged, and also plenty of drink options both alcoholic and the tea/coffee variety. Lounge got busier as the morning wore on but still very pleasant.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  Small lounge with a strange bell you have to ring in the terminal to get someone to let you in, Split into 2 sections one for First Class and one for Club Class. Small lounge with good seating, Very limited offerings, Tea, Coffee soft drinks and Alcohol. Some crisps a very small  selection of sandwiches and some cheese. Really depressing you would expect more especially at the prices we have paid. One member of staff on the desk and one (Male) floor walking but he really didn't want to be doing this or even working at all, If you don't want your job I am sure someone else would love it! Toilets were clean and tidy. Just looking forward to the NEW Terminal opening.\",\n",
       " '❌ Not Verified |  British Airways use this lounge in the International Terminal at Atlanta airport which is a shame given in the old International Terminal they had their own lounge which was head and shoulders above this offering. Upon arrival the lounge was already very full given the number of airlines using it and individuals who can access it via various flyer programmes. There were many dirty plates, glasses and cups on the tables and it appeared only one individual tasked with clearing them, not a great start. The carpet in many places was dirty and food scraps and litter was there for all to see. The food on offer was poor, in reality nothing more than snacks and the two packets of crisps my partner selected both had best before dates of July 2017, which I believe to be unacceptable. One staff member did engage, offering to get us some food, which we politely declined the rest were somewhat indifferent, given this is a customer facing service I was expecting better. Passengers travelling in the premium cabins of many of the airlines using this lounge will I am sure be deeply disappointed at the service offering, when compared with their airlines “own\" lounges. The airlines need to bring pressure for the service and quality to be improved as this is a disappointing way to end a trip.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Terminal 5 is one big box! Once through a painless security check it was off to find the BA lounge. First off was the North lounge. The lady said best to try the south one as that was extremely busy. So walked the length of the terminal (which itself is a very very busy place) and to the north lounge. This was far bigger and initially had space. The afternoon wore on and it became very packed. Commuter traffic across Europe is very busy and reflected in the lounge. So with that jumped onto the transit and to T5B concourse where there is a nice small lounge, very quiet, same food choices and had a decent shower and feed before departing. My advice? Use this lounge and not the ones in the main concourse.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  I was using this lounge as a customer of Qatar Airways, and the lounge is advertised as being open until 20:30. I arrived at 19:50 and it was clear that the surly woman at the reception was in going-home mood. She tried her best to send me to the other lounge that I qualified for, however eventually let me in. The lounge was in a terrible mess. The chars were out of position, newspaper rack in disarray, food selection was a mess. Then at 20:05 I tried to use the restroom, however the floor had already been mopped and the cleaning service cart was placed across the entrance, with the cleaner leaning on a lounge chair next to it, playing on his mobile. I asked him if the bathroom was closed. After a glare from him, he pushed back the cart for me. A moment later when I exited, I overheard him cursing in Italian. By far my worst lounge experience ever.',\n",
       " '❎ Not Verified |  This Terminal 1 BA lounge is better then sitting out in general airport seats, however it is too small for the amount of people they squeeze in. Food is just ok. Personally I prefer a seat with a table that I can use to do some work comfortably. For this reason I think there is too much high top and non table seats in this lounge.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The service is outstanding, very polite and very helpful. Staff was very professional assisting with towels for the shower. I left my phone and their honesty just made me smile. ',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  I've been using this lounge since 2013, it was originally the British Midland (BMI) lounge but when British Airways took over BMI in 2012 they did a complete refurbishment of the lounge and when the lounge was complete they moved into this lounge. It was a big improvement over the previous lounge offering more space, power sockets at every seat and different areas designed for work or relaxation. If you're a regular business traveller you'll appreciate this lounge, if you need to work there's plenty of desk space and if you're finished work and just want to relax there's plenty of comfy seats and a selection of food, hot and cold drinks including alcoholic options. It's my favourite of all the domestic lounges that BA operate. The ideal combination for a business traveller is having access to the BA lounge and flying on BA CityFlyer to London City Airport.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Flying BA in their club Europe class gave me access to this lounge - just showed boarding pass and no problem getting in. However there was no place to sit as it was overcrowded, hot and piles of empty glasses and plates at various tables. Drink selection looked good enough but food looked very basic. Due to the overcrowded lounge I turned around and left. This is the third time I have been to this small stuffy lounge and only once was it reasonably quiet enough to find a place to sit and relax. It’s just not big enough for the traffic they have signed up for.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Good selection of beverages, comfortable lounge, but always the same food served (chicken with a white gravy, pasta with a red sauce, chili-con-carne). That is okay if you only visit the lounge once in your lifetime, but for us who fly across the Atlantic every month it is very monotonous. ',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Warm welcome. Plenty of basic seating. Limited choice of food. They claim 340 seats - but there is 1 unisex shower and you need to ask for a towel (these are locked away in a separate cupboard). It’s a weak lounge compared to Galleries at T5. It’s not as nice as Berlin. It’s aweful compared to Cathay Pacific in Paris etc. It is miles better than Hannover. On the plus side - at least it’s air-side.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Modern, clean and well attended. Limited array of food and drink options, but everything was fresh and on point. They cater for children and vegetarians and the whole experience was really good. No where in the lounge where you can lay flat and limited seating for a major international - gives it a crowded feeling’. Multiple, individual showers with a ‘cupboard of useful stuff’ - including razors, combs etc - perfect if you’re travelling light. It comes behind the Galleries, way behind Cathay Pacific (Paris etc) - but trounces any German lounge.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  The lounge is much too small and the food selection is lacking in variety. The staff is rather dismissive in theeir attitude. Drinks were available with a wide selection. There is a second lounge across the hall where you have the option to dine before boarding - it is much larger as well as is accommodates Business Class passengers as well. I did not sample the food so I can't say anything about the selection or quality of the food available.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Okay lounge with edible food. Can be a bit too busy at times. They allow one guest only which I just found out applies to your children as well. As I have more than one child I could not use the lounge (or had to leave my 8 year old outside). So much for missing my family while travelling for work when BA does not allow me to share the achieved benefits with them. BA frequent flyer programme was already pretty useless - now I am out and will drop BA for good.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  After the hustle and bustle of the North and South lounges in Heathrow Terminal 5A, the smaller and much quieter lounge in B satellite is much appreciated. It offers a full range of drinks and a reasonable food selection, you can sit a down a chill without people rushing in and dashing out for a short haul A gate departure. The interior is slightly dated, but it is clean and the staff are helpful. Finding it is quite easy too, unlike some of the BA lounges in European airports.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Once you are past Sofia Airport security and in the terminal you turn left and go down some stairs into lounge overlooking the flight line.

Drinks selection are a bar, self pour draft beer , wines and spirits. Along with bottled water. Plenty of sofas and chairs & tables to work from. It has a former Communist atmosphere to it with the choice of colours and decorations.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Lounge small, barely enough seating. Towards boarding time it was overcrowded with people and luggage. Basic drinks offer, food was sub standard. Two small trays of sandwiches were brought and were almost inedible and ran out within minutes. Exactly same when I was there two years ago, I thought it was a problem that particular day but I now realise two years on it’s the norm and British Airways think that this is acceptable. It’s comes to something when the inflight food and service is 100% better than that on the ground!',\n",
       " \"✅ Verified Review |  Monday Morning this LHR North Lounge T5 lounge was crowded and hardly a seat to be found. Seating was comfortable a food available was tasty although queues long. Good selection of drinks, papers avaible. But it's hardly a lounge more like a morning cafe at rush hour as you couldn't truly relax. Toilets again are overwhelmed with passengers and I had to wait closecto 10 minutes just to use one cubicle as this was all they have. Couldn't see any showers to freshen up and they need to learn from the Hong Kong or Changi experience. Not a nice experience for passengers these days as it's no longer a lounge especially Monday mornings., a distinct lack of staff and the ones on duty were very disinterested in there job inside the lounge and hardly friendly - took an age to clean a table or remove used cups, glasses plates, passengers were seen removing plates so they could sit down and use there space for there plates etc., hardly what you pay the extra for when ones flies business class, wifi had a stable connection which was a kind of saving grace, but it's not a comfortable stay at this lounge.\",\n",
       " \"✅ Verified Review |  The old First lounge at Gatwick was terrible, but BA have redeemed themselves with the new one, which has a great view across the airfield. Food and drink remains the same as other 1st lounges - hot/cold buffet, self-service beer/wine (incl. champagne)/spirits. In terms of competitors, it's a slightly better business lounge rather than a genuine 1st class one.\",\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  The First lounge at T5 is getting worse and worse. The seating is now badly in need of some re-upholstery, with it looking cracked and worn in places. The choice of Champagne has declined; it used to be Bollinger and now it\\'s a house I\\'ve never heard of. The choice of magazines has been gutted, with all the readable stuff from yesteryear (The Week, Economist, Spectator) replaced with glossy fashion/high-art wibble. The food is OK, but they no longer leave the lounge menus out (I\\'m not even sure you can still order menu food?) and whilst it\\'s a bit of a first-world whinge to complain about it - they\\'ve not had Drambuie in the lounge all year, which means no more pre-flight \"rusty nails\". Much like the rest of BA\\'s proposition - a bit tired, off the pace and down-market.',\n",
       " \"✅ Verified Review |  BA lounges at Heathrow Terminal 5 and Edinburgh Airport. Not having flown BA Business Class for a decade, and having visited lounges in Asia and the Middle East airports, I was ready to compare. Unfortunately several flights to Edinburgh that day were delayed, which meant the lounge was packed, and noisy. There was no chance of finding a quiet area to relax. At first glance, I noticed several drinks displays. From loads of water and soft drinks, to a large selection of wines and premium spirits. Several magazine racks were scatted throughout and a small computer station. But it was the food that was the biggest disappointment. Just two small counters with a few salads, tasteless pastas, boiled rice, some concoction with mince and tiny pieces of chicken drowned in sauce. I ate, only because I was hungry and had to spend nearly three hours until my flight left. OK so it was busy and crowded, but there was no extra attempt by the staff to clear tables and clean up. I felt like I was in a canteen. To be fair, if the lounge was not so busy and one spent under an hour, it would be passable. But it showed how far the once 'world's favourite airline' has sunk so low in quality and customer care. On my return, the BA Club Lounge at Edinburgh was much better, spacious, clean and comfortable seating, with areas of privacy. The view was uninspiring, overlooking the car park. It was a morning flight, and again, the food area was simply pathetic. Just a few pastries and cereals - nothing to really appetize you with. It seems BA will offer the bare minimum, and nothing more.\",\n",
       " \"✅ Verified Review |  The Concorde Room at Terminal 7 in JFK airport is just a few metres past the fast-track security lane, and very convenient. Staff at the reception counter were quite curt and unfriendly, whilst in contrast the waiting and serving staff inside the lounge were most hospitable and friendly. The lounge was clean and comfortable, a good choice of UK newspapers but very poor magazine choices. There is an a la carte menu for lounge dining, I chose a soup and dessert to enable maximum sleep time on the flight - both dishes were too a good standard. This is an okay lounge, but underlines the fact hat BA no longer try to offer a proper level of luxury to First class fares paying customers - many business class lounges are better than BA's first class.\",\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  This \"Express\" lounge is a new lounge which has just opened next to Gate 8 in Terminal 1, the gate used for flights to Europe. Although available to all passengers on payment of $49.95, it is primarily meant for business class customers on BA and Norwegian. The lounge is small and so can get full very quickly. There was an interesting selection of food and a wide range of alcoholic beverages including some unusual craft beers. The staff was well-organised and helpful.',\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  Very poor Lounge at Malaga Airport, open to many airlines Premium Class passengers plus others who pay to use. Drinks okay but food very limited and not appetising. Poor sandwiches disappeared in a jiffy and not enough to go around. The chicken one I had was pretty nondescript. Seating comfortable but if you are looking for food & drink and comfort before your flight then only the latter is any good. Plenty of sockets to charge your laptop etc. I certainly would not pay to use this Lounge.',\n",
       " \"✅ Verified Review |  The Galleries South Lounge has lots of space, plenty of seating options, great coffee/snacks and a well stocked bar. Compared to the best lounges in Germany that BA has to offer (Berlin?) - this is an absolute joy.  In the 'business working areas', it would be nice to have 2.4a USB charge points.\",\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  This was the singularly most unpleasant experience ever. My wife and I were traveling First Class on BA to London, UK and were hoping to relax before the flight. The food was mostly inedible, the bathrooms were filthy, the personnel rude and inattentive. It appears that BA really does not give a damn about this facility.',\n",
       " \"❎ Unverified |  A most extraordinary third party lounge that British Airways use at this airport. The aircraft pier at Basel is 'Y' shaped with the lounge on top of the junction of the 'Y'. It is a huge 3 story circular structure with great views and (unusually) large smoking/viewing terraces. Although only the middle story was open when I visited, there was plenty of room. Drink options were OK but food was very limited to a few sandwiches and snacks. This definitely need improving, as otherwise it could be an excellent lounge.\",\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  Ashamed that this is our national carrier. This is supposed to be a first class lounge, with torn seats, lukewarm food and awful presentation. All waiting staff stayed behind the doors whilst people stared at empty trays and a few staff who cared trying to help - management clearly at below stupid criteria. Was keen to fly BA because have managed more than few miles across long haul carriers from UK (to Middle East and Asia Pacific) in business and first class and genuinely felt about time I tried.

       " '✅ Verified Review |  BA lounge at South Terminal, Gatwick Airport. Good selection of snacks and beverages. Nice ambiance in the lounge and good facilities. Nice welcome by the receptionist.

       " '✅ Verified Review |  This has probably got to be the worst airline lounge I have ever visited. The lady receptionist appeared miserable and not welcoming one tiny little bit. There was a very poor selection of beverages and even less selection of snacks. A bag of crisps or pizza flavoured very hard savoury biscuits. Seating was very comfortable. Toilet facilities not up to scratch. No hand towels or air hand dryers in the toilet.',\n",
       " \"❎ Unverified |  First impressions of the new lounge in the South terminal are not good, as access is via a maze of corridors and a lift. When you get there, the lounge is a freestanding 2 storey structure on the roof of the main departure lounge. This means floor to ceiling windows and good views. The 'ground' floor has some coffee stations, a bar with a wide variety of drinks and hot food (breakfast things when I arrived at 11am, stew, pasta and salad when I left an hour later). On the mezzanine, there was another coffee bar. There was plenty of comfortable seating. The mezzanine was a lot quieter so perhaps the place to sit at busy times. The lift then took me straight down to within yards of my departure gate. \",\n",

       " '❎ Unverified |  New lounge at Copenhagen airport located close to the departure lounge. Nice ambience as you walk into the lounge, but it is downhill from there. Food and drinks are cheap and of low quality. Virtually no English magazines, although a good selection of English news-papers. What is really hilarious is the BA banner as you walk into the lounge telling you about \"the upgraded lounge experience\".',\n",
       " '❎ Unverified |  The Aspire lounge at Zurich Airport is handy when you are a lone business traveller but for families or even couples it is simply not up to par. It is far too small with almost non existent service. Food and beverages are not sufficient. I will not be returning to this lounge.',\n",
       " '❎ Unverified |  BA new lounge at LGW. In spite of reported teething problems, the lounge is fully operational. Clean, well staffed and well laid out. Reasonable selection of breakfast food offerings in line with LHR offering. Good airport views from large windows. There is a small but well equipped childrens play area which was quite at the time of review. There is a good selection of magazines and news papers. A positive experience and well worth the wait.',\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  British Airways has its own lounge at Tegel-Airport which accomodates all oneworld peers and given the size of the airport, the lounge is pretty spacious, they seem to have used the space very efficently. It is placed before security (this means less time to spend there then usual) and the toilets are located 2 floors beneath, so you have to take the elevator to get there. There are public restrooms, they don\\'t belong to the lounge, but it is really not the fault of British Airways for this, I would rather say, the airport infrastructure made it like this. The persons at the reception are friendly and it is a pleasure to see them all the time smiling and ready to help you. The drinks are plentiful, it is not the case when it comes to food: they only have their \"signature\" sandwiches which are good and come in 4 or 5 varieties. The problem is that there is nothing more and they used to have some crisps. Now they were replaced by peanuts and to be onest I really miss those crisps. Considering that they only have a few flights from Tegel, it is nice of BA to have a lounge there and it is a good opportunity to spend the time before your flight.',\n",
       " \"✅ Verified Review |  As I read some reviews online, looks like this lounge was made by British Airways to accomodate the othere oneworld peers with status Emerald and not use their own Concorde Lounge. After reading about it, I wasn't expecting much and I could realise it wasn't a real first class lounge. It had some elements but I have seen better ones. I should start with the fact that it was crowded, yet not full, you could find a seat. About the food, there was a buffet with not so many things and the a la carte menu wasn't present, I had to ask an waiter about it. Then I ordered the famous British Airways Burger which wasn't great. Something was missing. The desserts were better whith a lot of choices (cakes and fruits) and good quality. The drinks, as in every lounge are plentfull and always there when you need them. In the desription there is a spa-area which I couldn't find. The toilets were very modern and very clean. A good place for spending the time between flights, nothing more.\",\n",
       " \"✅ Verified Review |  It was very quiet when I visited at 10am on a weekday. I'm always happy to be able to use a lounge when travelling - but I've been in better. There is no view over the airport. The lounge has windows but you can only see the adjacent building. Good choice of drinks. The food choice was not very good. A few pastries, some ham and cheese and sliced bread. There are no flight information screens in this lounge but they will announce your flight. Reasonably well located - only a short walk from the gates.\",\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  As my flight from Hong Kong arrives at 4:30am and no hotel will check you in, the BA Arrivals lounge is really useful. I did expect this lounge to be very good at the new T5. Not so, it is not bad, but the American Airlines Lounge at T3 after renovation is better and serves better food. But as I said, it is useful as you are not driven out to wander in the London street in winter time.',\n",
       " \"✅ Verified Review |  When I was invited by a friend to meet in the Concorde Room my expectation levels were high. Unfortunately, while it is nice - it falls short of BA's billing in too many ways. Far too much space has been allocated to the lounging area, which meant that the individual dining tables were cramped. The food was OK and the initial service was fast enough, but the empty plates and glasses stay on the table far too long - over half an hour in our case. The lounge area is richly decorated - which makes the hospital style restrooms a bit of a shock - complete with chipped doors/walls and tired styling. Overall, it's okay, but if you judged the Heathrow Terminal 5 Concorde Room as a hotel, you'd struggle to award it 5 stars. Terminal 5 is great, but BA needs to give the Concorde Room a rethink.\",\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  Very disappointed by the initial appearance of this British Airways Terminal 3 First Class lounge at London Heathrow. First impressions count for a lot but subsequent ones were not much better. Admittedly we had previously been spoiled by the BA LHR T5 Concorde Room lounge. The welcome was insincere, the lighting was dingy and there was no real service unless you ate in the so called restaurant part. Glasses and trash were not picked up in a timely manner, tables were not wiped. This lounge was definitely the poor relation of the T5 lounges. I only wish they would have similar standards across their 2 terminals. Given the choice I would rather not go from T3 (unless I was flying Virgin Atlantic).',\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  Excellent friendly and helpful staff. Well stocked with drinks, cheese, fruit, biscuits, snacks. Kept tidy in the lounge. More care could have taken with maintaining cleanliness in the toilets - although I may just have been unlucky in my timing, since I did see a cleaner going in 10 minutes later. Good electrics hookups for all plug variants kept both me and my daughter (and our technologies) happy!',\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  British Airways has its own lounge in Singapore. The lounge is a good size with plenty of seating and power points. Staff are okay not particularly friendly and did not provide any announcements about the delay in boarding. Gate closed at 19:35 and by 19:30 people began to question if they had missed the boarding call. Had to ask as did many others what was happening only to be told there was a 20 minute delay. Snacks and meals put out where the exact same in November as is December which thankfully was not too bad. WIFI was good and lots of power points to charge devices. Bathroom and showers are good.',\n",
       " 'This Heathrow Terminal 3 lounge has most that you might require - a restaurant, a spa, champagne bar, food and particularly good table wine. There is also lots of space. However, it lacks any pizaz or sparkle and is definitely not the Concorde Room. It can also be a long walk from the gates, but the design of T3 makes this unavoidable.',\n",
       " 'Common lounge for First and Business class passengers meant space was limited. Due to inefficient queues through security and passport control we only had around half an hour in the lounge. With the limited seating and food options and quality it was long enough. Think lukewarm curry and soggy pastries.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The lounge is clean but the seats are worn, and there is not enough space to accommodate all the passengers travelling in Club and those with silver and having access to the lounge. Nothing wrong, decent sandwiches but no hot food only soup, decent choice of alcoholic beverages and acceptable wines. Service with a smile. vOnly a shame the restrooms are extremely basic and not very clean.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The lounge is very spacious with a wide variety of areas to sit and a kids play area. Food was amazing with hot cooked foods at breakfast. Alcoholic beverages were limited to wine / sparking wine as it was morning. Very clean and showers are available, which was great after connecting from an overnight flight from New York. Staff were welcoming and friendly.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Tatty and uncared for, the BA business lounge in Gatwick South Terminal seems to be unloved and uncared for. The staff try hard but there is little loyalty (they do not work for BA) Information on flights is scarce due to them not working direct and on one occasion they were told by BA to “stop bothering them” when they were trying to ascertain the status of a much delayed flight. Despite the flight having been delayed for over five hours the customers were kicked out of the lounge two hours before boarding as it was closing. I would certainly never fly with this truly rotten and totally incompetent airline again.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Crowded or rather \"overcrowded\" as usual. The catering staff in the lounge are nice, polite and helpful - in contrast to the reception BA staff who are rude, abrasive and have no right to be facing customers. The toilets are terrible, long queues to access one, no urinals so all men have to queue up for the single toilets. As with so many other parts of the famous BA cost-cutting, all magazines and newspapers have not been returned after Covid, and this is now a further drop in standards. Food is okay, but hot food is real canteen style and not a match on many airlines first class standards. To call this a \"First\" lounge is a disgrace, and you are probably better off going to one of the restaurants in the main departure hall. And one thing you will note, Heathrow public toilets are nicer and kept cleaner than the BA lounge facilities. ',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Flew London to Kalamata and as a Silver/Saphire member used the Galleries South Lounge. COVID had meant that food offerings had been stripped back to a bare minimum, but I am pleased that a full service has been resumed. Quite busy but found two comfortable seats easily enough. Had a decent full English breakfast with a glass of champagne and very good cup or two of coffee. Much better, BA.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  We were at The British Airways Terminal 5 South Business Lounge at Heathrow Airport on the evening of April 24, 2023. We were shocked to see not one but three mice running under and around our chairs and table. The wait staff told me the lounge is infested with mice and that British Airways and Heathrow Airport have known about this for months. I was so disgusted that I left. I was then told by a flight attendant that their crew lounge is also infested with mice. Lastly, I was told by an airport meet and greet that the problem is not just limited to the British Air lounges. In addition to the active mice, the lounge was very dark, the tables were dirty as was the glassware. Totally disgusting and unacceptable. The health department needs to close the lounge in my opinion.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |\\xa0\\xa0A pretty underwhelming experience. The staff on the desk to greet us were quite cold and unwelcoming. The same was true of the staff on the baggage storage desk and the shower suite desk. The shower facilities were in desperate need of refurbishment. As is the lounge in general. The food on offer was quite nice and the atmosphere was quiet and relaxed which is what we needed after a very long flight. Bottom line though is BA really need to improve the quality of their staff and give this particular lounge a refresh.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled on a weekend which I never normally do, so was taken aback by how busy the lounge was. I did find a decent seat luckily, and tried from both the breakfast and lunch menu. Both offered a decent selection of nice food and beverages. On the wine side a really ordinary Prosecco was available to self serve but you needed to order champagne. I did find a really good Sauvignon which exceeded my expectations and only wish that happened more. The staff were very good at keeping a really busy lounge not looking too distressed with the volume of customers. Generally not a bad experience but hardly outstanding, I guess you need to head to the Gulf States for that.',\n",
       " \"Not Verified |  Arrived from Johannesburg and went to the Concorde Room for breakfast. Thirty minutes after ordering nothing arrived, apparently order lost between the dining area and the kitchen. Lounge not busy so no excuse for this shoddy level of service. It was a chaotic shambles, and given that this is BA's flagship lounge it was extremely disappointing. I eventually went to the First lounge and had breakfast there. The staff in the Concorde lounge really need a refresher course, there is no excuse for getting something so straightforward wrong.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  BA Business Class ticket holders access Escape Lounge, which is also a pay per use lounge. Compared with BA’s lounges around the world, this is as basic as it gets. Self service hot and cold snacks, soft drinks and tea/coffee. Alcohol on request from the bar. The wines are cheap and don’t compare to business class offerings at BA. Lounge is tidy. There’s a waste trolley on view where staff scrape dirty plates into the bin and stack dirty plates. Very off putting. Staff like to chat amongst themselves. The ‘meet and greet’ person on the lounge was glued to her chair and social media, shouting ‘Hiya’ and ‘See Ya’ every now and again. The lounge is a nice escape from the crowds downstairs with lots of charging points for devices.',\n",

Not even Jack Daniels if u don’t like Bulleit Bourbon. That includes onboard. Packed lounge with sun boiling anyone sitting in its way as there’s no window shading. Staff were working hard I felt given the amount of people. Bottled water removed. Shame as it was handy. Only tiny 250ml beer cans available. No Tiger or Amstel choices…',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Having paid BA over £7000 for our trip to Barbados we rather thought we might be able to get some breakfast before boarding. We tried a very overcrowded lounge soon after security and managed a small plate of baked beans. Toast and bacon were not on offer. A member of the lounge staff tipped us off that the business lounge in C satellite would be more comfortable so we went there. Much less crowded but the same lack of breakfast on offer.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The food was surprisingly good. Back to self service breakfast and lunch. Plenty of drinks selection but sadly no more Gentleman Jack or Woodford Reserve. Also no Zacapa rum which is  disappointing. Bulleit bourbon is simply awful. For a Saturday afternoon, there was plenty of seats. Staff all very polite and friendly.',\n",

In fact this is one of the best lounges we have visited and we have been to many other business lounges. Its nearly up there with Istanbul and Singapore. Very well laid out, with plenty of space and places to sit/eat. The choice and variety of food was excellent. We arrived just at the breakfast/ lunch changeover. So, we had a pretty great choice!! This lounge is in total contrast to the Swiss Business lounge at Zurich which we visited the day before that was just pathetic.  A very good lounge.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  Way too crowded with many people walking around looking for a place to sit. No champagne at the champagne bar (although a staff member did bring a tray of filled glasses after mentioning that passengers were walking off with the bottles!) BA used to have a display in the terminal showing how crowded each of the T5 lounges were, but that wasn't visible this time. Staff were trying valiantly, but the number of people was simply too much for them to do more than the bare minimum of clearing glasses and dishes. Next time I think I'll just have a glass of champagne and some nice oysters outside - even if I have to pay, it will definitely be more comfortable and less stressful.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Awful experience. Overcrowded, inedible food, disgusting toilets. We left almost immediately and went to sit in the Terminal. BA should be ashamed of this facility.',\n",

I had a nice cream tea, though I avoided the tea and had strawberry Baileys instead, the scone was excellent the clotted cream great and the strawberry jam nice, after that I went through to the rest area where high-tech seats are available but I have a 20 minute limit, however since there were very few people waiting I just used another and another 20 minutes with no problem, Disadvantages of the BA lounge were that there were very few charging points available beside the seats in the rest area there was a charging point but elsewhere they were few and far between, The drink selection was good apart from a rather unusual absence of cognac Armagnac or brandy, however the strawberry Baileys and birthday cake Baileys along with a wide selection of other choices made up for the missing Brandy. The food was excellent. ',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Terminal 5B lounge is so much better than the T5A lounge. Nice and quiet. It is worth the train and walk back to the main terminal. The lounge at T5A is huge and quite impersonal.',\n",

       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Used on Wednesday 16 March before our flight to Barbados. Busy but could still find a comfortable seat, and a reasonable selection of drinks on offer. Coffee machines working this time (most were not November 2021), and very good coffee it was. Unfortunately and as I suspected in November 2021 the food offering has further declined: the hot offering was just a Bacon Roll only this time without even hash browns. A couple of nice pastries on offer. It is clear that BA are now using COVID as the excuse to downgrade their offerings and cost cut. What used to be a very nice lounge with a decent buffet breakfast selection has now gone for good, I fear.',\n",

       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Nice views of the runway in one section but very crowded and thus uncomfortable. Good selection of drinks but their app system of ordering food (no buffet) means that when it gets delivered to your table means it is cold. Weird setup in there and certainly not conducive to a relaxed wait for your flight. I am sure that BA can do better, stressed passengers do not deal with the inevitable delayed flight as well as relaxed ones.',\n",

       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Used this Lounge on 5th November before our flight to Tenerife. Still a reasonably comfortable place to wait for your flight with a good selection of drinks. However, since COVID-19 the standard of the food offering has declined dramatically with just a Bacon Roll and Hash Browns as the main hot offering. Food also has to be ordered by a Lounge App and you will be served at your table. At least 2 of the coffee machines were not working and causing problems. No longer a real Premium offering - one can only hope that when COVID eventually dies down the lounge can return to its former decent buffet. But I\\'m not holding my breath - BA may just use this as an excuse to become the new \"normal\" lounge service.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  This was the first time using this Terminal 5 lounge after recently becoming a British Airways Executive Club Gold Member. I was travelling on an Economy Hand Baggage only flight with a non status friend and he was allowed to enter as my guest. There isn't a huge difference between the Business and the First Class lounge. You still have the British Airways, NHS style Showers and Toilets. Furnishings that aren't too modern and the lack of that truly luxurious feel. But, There is an upgrade in the drinks variety. More premium brands of drinks. This visit was during Covid and so you had to order food and snacks by scanning a QR code, entering your table number and placing your order. BA lounges have never been truly luxurious, If you have one world status you are better off visiting the likes of Cathay Pacific whose bathrooms are beautifully designed, tiled and contain Aesop products. But if you want an English Breakfast for instance. BA is your best bet.\",\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  I visited this lounge in March when travel reduced because of the virus. This lounge is used by Aer Lingus and other OneWorld Elites which make this lounge crowded, especially in the evening. The snack options in the lounge are decent and something you can work with. This lounge has no windows and very low ceilings which make it gloomy. Club Dining is a nice option and highly recommended, it's less crowded than the rest of the lounge because of restricted access and a good choice of hot food in response to BA's sleeper service.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  This American Airlines Admirals Club lounge was very basic with limited food and drink options, plenty of different seating areas but it was a real let down and not worth using in my opinion. I expected more but would advise just sitting in main terminal and paying for some food, I am surprised this is an American Airlines Lounge but they must be easily pleased. Would not bother using or even go to the bother of finding the lounge. If you just want a drink and a cracker then you will love it. Total waste of time,',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  I used the Terminal 5 North Lounge as I find this lounge less busy. Plenty of seats today so no problems for me. Food was very hit and miss, some strange bread Rolls with Bacon, they were heavily seeded and strange, not to my liking what is wrong with plain?  Plenty of hot, cold and soft drinks as well as the usual alcohol.  Today's use of lounge was fine a bit busier as the morning went on, toilets needed cleaning.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The lounge is divided into business and first and has been renovated. Late evening the Club World lounge was quiet. Plentiful seating, decent selection of drinks. I found the F & B is nowhere near the standards of AA with their Flagship lounge or other One World ones I most often use. Maybe it was later in the evening but quality felt lacking. The ambience was very flat. Terminal 7 at JFK is the BA terminal and whilst great for BA and its One World partners to have its own space, its a very tired terminal. Washrooms are still the same cramped space and the showers clearly have not been renovated.',\n",

       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The Concorde Lounge is a place to relax and a place to eat. Superb service and good space. You can sit inside the lounge or the area outside above the departure hall if you like some more buzz. Nice dining area and good food. Only downside is there are a little short of bathrooms.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The Club World and First Galleries Lounge at Johannesburg has been the subject of much needed refurbishment and reflects a new harmonised policy for housing both classes under one roof without as overt a distinction as before. To be honest, the previous First lounge was something of an embarrassment, with too few seats and general feeling of being cramped. The new arrangement eschews a separate First lounge but allocates a separate First dining area. This seems to work reasonably well. The rest of the lounge is by no means spacious but there are adequate seats to accommodation the Club and First passengers on the two evening flights to LHR. The food seems to substantially better than before, with regular refreshes of both hot and cold food. The bar area is spacious as bar areas go and service was good. Overall, the new Galleries Lounge is a definite improvement for Club passengers; First passengers may not agree, of course.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  After a subpar visit to the Qantas Lounge next door, my partner and I decided to give the British Airways Lounge a go. It was a completely different experience, a much better one in my opinion. The space had such character with striking decors along with a great layout for dining, work and relaxation. The catering was fantastic with plenty of options for food and beverages with plenty of comfortable seating to enjoy it. Customer service was average, lounge team were present and making sure food was plentiful plus consistently tidying but lack face to face service. Shower facilities were adequate but lacked in numbers. Overall, a great visit as I would definitely pick this lounge over the Qantas and third party offerings.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Main Galleries Lounge in Terminal 5 at Heathrow was very busy. Food options were very good and plentiful. The main Lounge A-Gates, as usual, were very busy, not helped when some of the U shaped seating areas have massive square tables making it difficult for people to get seated (very bad design) We had a C-Gate departure so left the lounge and went to the quieter Lounge in the B-gate area which I would always recommend people to do.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  Cathay Pacific uses this lounge for their Washington flights to HKG. The lounge is nice but most sections were shut as it is 11pm at night. There was no hot food apart from soup and there are  sandwiches on offer and lots of fresh fruit. The usual tea and coffee and white and red wine plus a few beers.  If you plan to dine before you fly so you can catch maximum sleep on the plane, don't plan on doing it in this lounge which is miserable. The toilets were not clean with paper towels everywhere. The staff were pleasant enough. CX needs to do something about their lounge access in IAD.\",\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  The BA lounge at Newark Airport is very nicely appointed with good food (the steak and ale pie on offer that evening was delicious) and plenty of seating throughout. The female toilets were also spotlessly clean and tidy. I was very happy to see Rosa there again, this staff member and all the team work very hard to keep customers happy.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  I used the business lounge \"south\" on Heathrow T5 and as usual it was rather busy. Plenty of newspapers , magazines and books available to read and decent internet. There is plenty of food, pastries and chocolates, fruits and yoghurts. Also bread filled with bacon, however no cheese or ham available - jams and marmalade out of big tins. Ample choice of teas and coffee. Also - despite it was rather early - lots of wines and alcoholic beverages (even better brands like Grey Goose) and sodas. There is a lot to eat and to drink, only a shame the food is not refined.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Really looking forward to the New Airport opening. The old lounge is very odd, at least you no longer have to ring the bell to get in but you do have to knock on the door. It is rather small and the offerings are miserable just a few sandwiches on a plate( total 12 cut quarters at a time) a selection of cheese, crisps and some fruit, a strange man (always the same one) who wanders around and refills. you have a selection of drinks and a few TV screens. Not what you expect from a Club Lounge but it has always been the same. Toilets ok, again limited, Roll on 2020.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Plenty of space and lots of seats to choose at the Gatwick Club World Lounge, the food selections (it was lunchtime 12:30) were very good. Not the usual finger treats and a few sandwiches but a good selection of Chilli meatballs, chicken stew with beans, baked potatoes, rice (cooked very well) and the sandwiches and nibbles. I was absolutely full and thoroughly enjoyed my stay ion the lounge. Toilets and showers were all clean and tidy. For once a very pleasant stay. WiFi worked well.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  BA Business Class passengers share a lounge with Priority Pass customers and several other airlines. The lounge itself was extremely busy but there's a cordoned off area at one end for BA passengers which is dark and cramped. However, when we arrived two hours before our flight there were no seats. We had to wait until other passengers left. The food was poor - a couple of types of wrap and some crispy egg sandwiches on rye plus soup and a tired tray of salad ingredients. We discovered subsequently that the food in the main area was fresher - probably due to the high number of people.The only nibbles were wasabi peas, stale pretzels and a variety of different sweets. There's a bar in the main area but the wine wasn't properly chilled. The free wifi was open but quick. We were extremely disappointed with this lounge as Atlanta is a major hub and we were hoping to get dinner there so we could sleep on our flight.\",\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  This is not a British Airways lounge but a third party Airport Lounge that BA uses for their passengers. The lounge is small, full of people and not comfortable at all. There was almost not food and just drinks however selection of drinks was really poor. Overwhelming noisy making impossible to relax before a flight. Staff was rude, useless and they were clearly upset as we don't speak German and had to talk to us in English.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Appalling lounge in Terminal 3. Food mediocre at best  and no gluten free options. Not enough easy chairs so had to sit on a stool. Dreary and depressing decor. Will try a different airline.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  This lounge opened at Logan last year after a bit of a revamp of Terminal E. It caters for First, Business and Silver/ Gold passengers (I accessed using the latter). Despite flying on the first evening service of the day, the lounge wasn't busy, and it's very spacious. There's a view of the apron from the far end with large windows and bar style seating next to them. Near the entrance is the usual self service bar and snacks, similar to the BA Galleries lounges in Heathrow and Gatwick. Down the far end, however, is a full service bar. The staff there were fantastic, and constantly brought me over another drink as soon as they saw my glass was empty. Pre flight dining is available from 5pm from a buffet, which had a good selection and the food was nice. There's also a Concorde dining area for F passengers. The real bonus with this lounge is that you board the aircraft directly from the lounge, which is positioned above the boarding gate. The staff were all fantastic, so friendly and obliging. This is quite possibly the best BA lounge I've experienced - I'd easily rate it above the flagship Concorde Room! It's that good!\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The Galleries First lounge is little more than a corridor next to the Club World lounge. There are adequate seats for the small number of BA flights leaving JNB at night. Food is self-service and includes a fair selection of hot and cold options. Drinks are limited in choice and champagne is Larssen rather than Laurent Perrier. Unfortunately, because of the compact size of the space, loud transatlantic smartphone conversations can easily disturb the peace.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Approached staff to ask if it would be possible to use the lounge for an hour prior to my connecting flight to Scotland after travelling from the US. I understood that I would be potentially charged, but nevertheless asked if I could use it for free. I was  turned away and not even offered any use of the facilities even if I had to pay. I think that this is absolutely disgusting, considering the respect and gratitude offered and given to me by American Airlines, including speedy boarding given to military. ',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Menzies Aurora Lounge used by British Airways. One word: Worthless. Could be a hotel foyer or something. Not what you expect with a business class fares!',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  Very attentive staff but the lounge needs a touch up badly. Furniture looks like it's from the 80th. Selection of drinks, food and coffee was quite average. Had breakfast before a flight and the scrambled eggs gets 5 stars! Champagne served was really mediocre and not first class standard. But not having towels in the bathroom makes them like any bathroom in the terminal. They have those awful hand blow dryers. Re-do and do it right British Airways.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The lounge itself is not too bad except for the quality of the light: no natural light and really bad artificial light. The really unacceptable thing is the music level, really too high! And also the music selection, it was all about 80’ hits. This is really far from relaxing or working time. I had to spend 3 hours and I asked at least 4 times to the attendants to do something but without success.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  As Business Class lounges go this one is pretty poor. For a flight with 72+ Business Class seats there is barely enough space for this many people and certainly not comfortably. It's cramped and faces the evening sun so very warm. The choice of 'food' is very minimal. The bar is served through a hatch with a queue every time for a drink and a limited selection. There are less bathrooms in this lounge than on the aircraft so time your visit carefully.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  The lounge in Changi airport are pretty spacious. Considering that there are consecutively two flights (by 777 and A380) departing to London within 30 minutes, however, the lounge was not as crowded as I expected. There were a wide selection of drinks and alcohol but the choice for food was a bit limited: only three kinds of main dish with pasta and mashed potato. The staff here were nice with great hospitality.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  I went to the Heathrow T5 arrival lounge for showering and breakfast after a 14 hours long flight from Singapore. The lounge located right after custom clearance and it's very easy to find. The reception staff were very hospitable but the lady staff in charge of assigning shower rooms was a bit inpatient. The food was nice and there were a lot of choices for breakfast. In general it was a very refreshing experience.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Lounge feels very cold and impersonal, Not very organised, by the time you find anything it’s time to go. I am sure the staff are wonderful, however, I feel they have to much work not enough workers to keep up. Food unfortunately is nothing special! The Bars are far apart, again nothing to write home about. Also upon entering the lounge I was not told the WIFI password so I will not rate that. Asked if my friend could possibly pay to get in and was told it is an invite (I get it) but what do you pay these extortionate prices for? Maybe get hold of the British airways lounge in Singapore and get some ideas from them and also they are so much more friendly, a nice smile goes along way! I have been asked if I would recommend the airline - airline yes the lounge in London Heathrow “No”',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely rammed. I used to be Emerald with one world until two years ago when I changed alliances. First Class lounge at Heathrow is probably my favourite in the world, it was hard to make the decision to lose that. I don't think I have been in the business class lounge at T5 for 5 years but it has deteriorated. There were people lying across sofas as one would see in a bus station, the place looked dishevelled, it really looked like a pay to enter lounge. I did not have time to sample the food on offer but BA normally has decent food and the drinks selection was good. BA needs to think about either making more space available for frequent travellers or lifting the number of tier points to achieve Sapphire status because this lounge is simply no longer a pleasant environment to spend any significant period of time.\",\n",
       " \"Not Verified |  Used BA's Club and First Lounge. Got there early as 2 BA flights that day about 3 hours apart so was reasonably busy. Found 2 comfortable seats in a quiet corner without any problem. Good choice of beverages - beers, wines and spirits - and had a glass of Prosecco brought to us. Very nice helpful staff who cleared up tables and refreshed the rather limited food options frequently. In common with most North American lounges the food options for Business passengers was limited to 3 types of sandwiches, vegetarian wraps, potato crisps nuts and two types of cheese cut into squares. No hot/cooked choices. Notwithstanding the limited choice of food it was a comfortable and quiet enough place to while away a couple of hours before the flight.\",\n",
       " 'Not Verified |  Flew from LHR Saturday 7th July and used the T5 Galleries Lounge (North, I think). Plenty of room, not too crowded and easy to find comfy seats for my wife and I. Actually quite a good choice of hot and cold breakfast food so indulged, and also plenty of drink options both alcoholic and the tea/coffee variety. Lounge got busier as the morning wore on but still very pleasant.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  Small lounge with a strange bell you have to ring in the terminal to get someone to let you in, Split into 2 sections one for First Class and one for Club Class. Small lounge with good seating, Very limited offerings, Tea, Coffee soft drinks and Alcohol. Some crisps a very small  selection of sandwiches and some cheese. Really depressing you would expect more especially at the prices we have paid. One member of staff on the desk and one (Male) floor walking but he really didn't want to be doing this or even working at all, If you don't want your job I am sure someone else would love it! Toilets were clean and tidy. Just looking forward to the NEW Terminal opening.\",\n",
       " '❌ Not Verified |  British Airways use this lounge in the International Terminal at Atlanta airport which is a shame given in the old International Terminal they had their own lounge which was head and shoulders above this offering. Upon arrival the lounge was already very full given the number of airlines using it and individuals who can access it via various flyer programmes. There were many dirty plates, glasses and cups on the tables and it appeared only one individual tasked with clearing them, not a great start. The carpet in many places was dirty and food scraps and litter was there for all to see. The food on offer was poor, in reality nothing more than snacks and the two packets of crisps my partner selected both had best before dates of July 2017, which I believe to be unacceptable. One staff member did engage, offering to get us some food, which we politely declined the rest were somewhat indifferent, given this is a customer facing service I was expecting better. Passengers travelling in the premium cabins of many of the airlines using this lounge will I am sure be deeply disappointed at the service offering, when compared with their airlines “own\" lounges. The airlines need to bring pressure for the service and quality to be improved as this is a disappointing way to end a trip.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Terminal 5 is one big box! Once through a painless security check it was off to find the BA lounge. First off was the North lounge. The lady said best to try the south one as that was extremely busy. So walked the length of the terminal (which itself is a very very busy place) and to the north lounge. This was far bigger and initially had space. The afternoon wore on and it became very packed. Commuter traffic across Europe is very busy and reflected in the lounge. So with that jumped onto the transit and to T5B concourse where there is a nice small lounge, very quiet, same food choices and had a decent shower and feed before departing. My advice? Use this lounge and not the ones in the main concourse.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  I was using this lounge as a customer of Qatar Airways, and the lounge is advertised as being open until 20:30. I arrived at 19:50 and it was clear that the surly woman at the reception was in going-home mood. She tried her best to send me to the other lounge that I qualified for, however eventually let me in. The lounge was in a terrible mess. The chars were out of position, newspaper rack in disarray, food selection was a mess. Then at 20:05 I tried to use the restroom, however the floor had already been mopped and the cleaning service cart was placed across the entrance, with the cleaner leaning on a lounge chair next to it, playing on his mobile. I asked him if the bathroom was closed. After a glare from him, he pushed back the cart for me. A moment later when I exited, I overheard him cursing in Italian. By far my worst lounge experience ever.',\n",
       " '❎ Not Verified |  This Terminal 1 BA lounge is better then sitting out in general airport seats, however it is too small for the amount of people they squeeze in. Food is just ok. Personally I prefer a seat with a table that I can use to do some work comfortably. For this reason I think there is too much high top and non table seats in this lounge.',\n",

       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  I've been using this lounge since 2013, it was originally the British Midland (BMI) lounge but when British Airways took over BMI in 2012 they did a complete refurbishment of the lounge and when the lounge was complete they moved into this lounge. It was a big improvement over the previous lounge offering more space, power sockets at every seat and different areas designed for work or relaxation. If you're a regular business traveller you'll appreciate this lounge, if you need to work there's plenty of desk space and if you're finished work and just want to relax there's plenty of comfy seats and a selection of food, hot and cold drinks including alcoholic options. It's my favourite of all the domestic lounges that BA operate. The ideal combination for a business traveller is having access to the BA lounge and flying on BA CityFlyer to London City Airport.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Flying BA in their club Europe class gave me access to this lounge - just showed boarding pass and no problem getting in. However there was no place to sit as it was overcrowded, hot and piles of empty glasses and plates at various tables. Drink selection looked good enough but food looked very basic. Due to the overcrowded lounge I turned around and left. This is the third time I have been to this small stuffy lounge and only once was it reasonably quiet enough to find a place to sit and relax. It’s just not big enough for the traffic they have signed up for.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Good selection of beverages, comfortable lounge, but always the same food served (chicken with a white gravy, pasta with a red sauce, chili-con-carne). That is okay if you only visit the lounge once in your lifetime, but for us who fly across the Atlantic every month it is very monotonous. ',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Warm welcome. Plenty of basic seating. Limited choice of food. They claim 340 seats - but there is 1 unisex shower and you need to ask for a towel (these are locked away in a separate cupboard). It’s a weak lounge compared to Galleries at T5. It’s not as nice as Berlin. It’s aweful compared to Cathay Pacific in Paris etc. It is miles better than Hannover. On the plus side - at least it’s air-side.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Modern, clean and well attended. Limited array of food and drink options, but everything was fresh and on point. They cater for children and vegetarians and the whole experience was really good. No where in the lounge where you can lay flat and limited seating for a major international - gives it a crowded feeling’. Multiple, individual showers with a ‘cupboard of useful stuff’ - including razors, combs etc - perfect if you’re travelling light. It comes behind the Galleries, way behind Cathay Pacific (Paris etc) - but trounces any German lounge.',\n",
       " \"✅ Trip Verified |  The lounge is much too small and the food selection is lacking in variety. The staff is rather dismissive in theeir attitude. Drinks were available with a wide selection. There is a second lounge across the hall where you have the option to dine before boarding - it is much larger as well as is accommodates Business Class passengers as well. I did not sample the food so I can't say anything about the selection or quality of the food available.\",\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Okay lounge with edible food. Can be a bit too busy at times. They allow one guest only which I just found out applies to your children as well. As I have more than one child I could not use the lounge (or had to leave my 8 year old outside). So much for missing my family while travelling for work when BA does not allow me to share the achieved benefits with them. BA frequent flyer programme was already pretty useless - now I am out and will drop BA for good.',\n",

It offers a full range of drinks and a reasonable food selection, you can sit a down a chill without people rushing in and dashing out for a short haul A gate departure. The interior is slightly dated, but it is clean and the staff are helpful. Finding it is quite easy too, unlike some of the BA lounges in European airports.',\n",
       " '✅ Trip Verified |  Once you are past Sofia Airport security and in the terminal you turn left and go down some stairs into lounge overlooking the flight line.

Drinks selection are a bar, self pour draft beer , wines and spirits. Along with bottled water. Plenty of sofas and chairs & tables to work from. It has a former Communist atmosphere to it with the choice of colours and decorations.',\n",

Two small trays of sandwiches were brought and were almost inedible and ran out within minutes. Exactly same when I was there two years ago, I thought it was a problem that particular day but I now realise two years on it’s the norm and British Airways think that this is acceptable. It’s comes to something when the inflight food and service is 100% better than that on the ground!',\n",

Good selection of drinks, papers avaible. But it's hardly a lounge more like a morning cafe at rush hour as you couldn't truly relax. Toilets again are overwhelmed with passengers and I had to wait closecto 10 minutes just to use one cubicle as this was all they have. Couldn't see any showers to freshen up and they need to learn from the Hong Kong or Changi experience. Not a nice experience for passengers these days as it's no longer a lounge especially Monday mornings., a distinct lack of staff and the ones on duty were very disinterested in there job inside the lounge and hardly friendly - took an age to clean a table or remove used cups, glasses plates, passengers were seen removing plates so they could sit down and use there space for there plates etc., hardly what you pay the extra for when ones flies business class, wifi had a stable connection which was a kind of saving grace, but it's not a comfortable stay at this lounge.\",\n",

In terms of competitors, it's a slightly better business lounge rather than a genuine 1st class one.\",\n",

The choice of magazines has been gutted, with all the readable stuff from yesteryear (The Week, Economist, Spectator) replaced with glossy fashion/high-art wibble. The food is OK, but they no longer leave the lounge menus out (I\\'m not even sure you can still order menu food?) and whilst it\\'s a bit of a first-world whinge to complain about it - they\\'ve not had Drambuie in the lounge all year, which means no more pre-flight \"rusty nails\".

Not having flown BA Business Class for a decade, and having visited lounges in Asia and the Middle East airports, I was ready to compare. Unfortunately several flights to Edinburgh that day were delayed, which meant the lounge was packed, and noisy. There was no chance of finding a quiet area to relax. At first glance, I noticed several drinks displays. From loads of water and soft drinks, to a large selection of wines and premium spirits. Several magazine racks were scatted throughout and a small computer station. But it was the food that was the biggest disappointment. Just two small counters with a few salads, tasteless pastas, boiled rice, some concoction with mince and tiny pieces of chicken drowned in sauce. I ate, only because I was hungry and had to spend nearly three hours until my flight left. OK so it was busy and crowded, but there was no extra attempt by the staff to clear tables and clean up. I felt like I was in a canteen. To be fair, if the lounge was not so busy and one spent under an hour, it would be passable. But it showed how far the once 'world's favourite airline' has sunk so low in quality and customer care. On my return, the BA Club Lounge at Edinburgh was much better, spacious, clean and comfortable seating, with areas of privacy. The view was uninspiring, overlooking the car park. It was a morning flight, and again, the food area was simply pathetic. Just a few pastries and cereals - nothing to really appetize you with. It seems BA will offer the bare minimum, and nothing more.\",\n",
       " \"✅ Verified Review |  The Concorde Room at Terminal 7 in JFK airport is just a few metres past the fast-track security lane, and very convenient. Staff at the reception counter were quite curt and unfriendly, whilst in contrast the waiting and serving staff inside the lounge were most hospitable and friendly. The lounge was clean and comfortable, a good choice of UK newspapers but very poor magazine choices. There is an a la carte menu for lounge dining, I chose a soup and dessert to enable maximum sleep time on the flight - both dishes were too a good standard. This is an okay lounge, but underlines the fact hat BA no longer try to offer a proper level of luxury to First class fares paying customers - many business class lounges are better than BA's first class.\",\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  This \"Express\" lounge is a new lounge which has just opened next to Gate 8 in Terminal 1, the gate used for flights to Europe. Although available to all passengers on payment of $49.95, it is primarily meant for business class customers on BA and Norwegian. The lounge is small and so can get full very quickly. There was an interesting selection of food and a wide range of alcoholic beverages including some unusual craft beers. The staff was well-organised and helpful.',\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  Very poor Lounge at Malaga Airport, open to many airlines Premium Class passengers plus others who pay to use. Drinks okay but food very limited and not appetising. Poor sandwiches disappeared in a jiffy and not enough to go around. The chicken one I had was pretty nondescript. Seating comfortable but if you are looking for food & drink and comfort before your flight then only the latter is any good. Plenty of sockets to charge your laptop etc. I certainly would not pay to use this Lounge.',\n",
       " \"✅ Verified Review |  The Galleries South Lounge has lots of space, plenty of seating options, great coffee/snacks and a well stocked bar. Compared to the best lounges in Germany that BA has to offer (Berlin?) - this is an absolute joy.  In the 'business working areas', it would be nice to have 2.4a USB charge points.\",\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  This was the singularly most unpleasant experience ever. My wife and I were traveling First Class on BA to London, UK and were hoping to relax before the flight. The food was mostly inedible, the bathrooms were filthy, the personnel rude and inattentive. It appears that BA really does not give a damn about this facility.',\n",
       " \"❎ Unverified |  A most extraordinary third party lounge that British Airways use at this airport. The aircraft pier at Basel is 'Y' shaped with the lounge on top of the junction of the 'Y'. It is a huge 3 story circular structure with great views and (unusually) large smoking/viewing terraces. Although only the middle story was open when I visited, there was plenty of room. Drink options were OK but food was very limited to a few sandwiches and snacks. This definitely need improving, as otherwise it could be an excellent lounge.\",\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  Ashamed that this is our national carrier. This is supposed to be a first class lounge, with torn seats, lukewarm food and awful presentation. All waiting staff stayed behind the doors whilst people stared at empty trays and a few staff who cared trying to help - management clearly at below stupid criteria. Was keen to fly BA because have managed more than few miles across long haul carriers from UK (to Middle East and Asia Pacific) in business and first class and genuinely felt about time I tried. ',\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  BA lounge at South Terminal, Gatwick Airport. Good selection of snacks and beverages. Nice ambiance in the lounge and good facilities. Nice welcome by the receptionist. Staff in the lounge very attentive clearing tables quickly. Good selection of reading materials. Seating comfortable and not over crowded. Nice peaceful start to the start of our trip.',\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  This has probably got to be the worst airline lounge I have ever visited. The lady receptionist appeared miserable and not welcoming one tiny little bit. There was a very poor selection of beverages and even less selection of snacks. A bag of crisps or pizza flavoured very hard savoury biscuits. Seating was very comfortable. Toilet facilities not up to scratch. No hand towels or air hand dryers in the toilet.',\n",
       " \"❎ Unverified |  First impressions of the new lounge in the South terminal are not good, as access is via a maze of corridors and a lift. When you get there, the lounge is a freestanding 2 storey structure on the roof of the main departure lounge. This means floor to ceiling windows and good views. The 'ground' floor has some coffee stations, a bar with a wide variety of drinks and hot food (breakfast things when I arrived at 11am, stew, pasta and salad when I left an hour later). On the mezzanine, there was another coffee bar. There was plenty of comfortable seating. The mezzanine was a lot quieter so perhaps the place to sit at busy times. The lift then took me straight down to within yards of my departure gate. \",\n",
       " '❎ Unverified |  Astonishingly good lounge opened 15th march, with freshly cooked food (and chef), bar, drinks etc. Bright, airy, on 4th floor and plenty of space for work etc.  Concorde lounge quality available to Silver up - would definitely recommend.',\n",
       " '❎ Unverified |  New lounge at Copenhagen airport located close to the departure lounge. Nice ambience as you walk into the lounge, but it is downhill from there. Food and drinks are cheap and of low quality. Virtually no English magazines, although a good selection of English news-papers. What is really hilarious is the BA banner as you walk into the lounge telling you about \"the upgraded lounge experience\".',\n",
       " '❎ Unverified |  The Aspire lounge at Zurich Airport is handy when you are a lone business traveller but for families or even couples it is simply not up to par. It is far too small with almost non existent service. Food and beverages are not sufficient. I will not be returning to this lounge.',\n",
       " '❎ Unverified |  BA new lounge at LGW. In spite of reported teething problems, the lounge is fully operational. Clean, well staffed and well laid out. Reasonable selection of breakfast food offerings in line with LHR offering. Good airport views from large windows. There is a small but well equipped childrens play area which was quite at the time of review. There is a good selection of magazines and news papers. A positive experience and well worth the wait.',\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  British Airways has its own lounge at Tegel-Airport which accomodates all oneworld peers and given the size of the airport, the lounge is pretty spacious, they seem to have used the space very efficently. It is placed before security (this means less time to spend there then usual) and the toilets are located 2 floors beneath, so you have to take the elevator to get there. There are public restrooms, they don\\'t belong to the lounge, but it is really not the fault of British Airways for this, I would rather say, the airport infrastructure made it like this. The persons at the reception are friendly and it is a pleasure to see them all the time smiling and ready to help you. The drinks are plentiful, it is not the case when it comes to food: they only have their \"signature\" sandwiches which are good and come in 4 or 5 varieties. The problem is that there is nothing more and they used to have some crisps. Now they were replaced by peanuts and to be onest I really miss those crisps. Considering that they only have a few flights from Tegel, it is nice of BA to have a lounge there and it is a good opportunity to spend the time before your flight.',\n",
       " \"✅ Verified Review |  As I read some reviews online, looks like this lounge was made by British Airways to accomodate the othere oneworld peers with status Emerald and not use their own Concorde Lounge. After reading about it, I wasn't expecting much and I could realise it wasn't a real first class lounge. It had some elements but I have seen better ones. I should start with the fact that it was crowded, yet not full, you could find a seat. About the food, there was a buffet with not so many things and the a la carte menu wasn't present, I had to ask an waiter about it. Then I ordered the famous British Airways Burger which wasn't great. Something was missing. The desserts were better whith a lot of choices (cakes and fruits) and good quality. The drinks, as in every lounge are plentfull and always there when you need them. In the desription there is a spa-area which I couldn't find. The toilets were very modern and very clean. A good place for spending the time between flights, nothing more.\",\n",
       " \"✅ Verified Review |  It was very quiet when I visited at 10am on a weekday. I'm always happy to be able to use a lounge when travelling - but I've been in better. There is no view over the airport. The lounge has windows but you can only see the adjacent building. Good choice of drinks. The food choice was not very good. A few pastries, some ham and cheese and sliced bread. There are no flight information screens in this lounge but they will announce your flight. Reasonably well located - only a short walk from the gates.\",\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  As my flight from Hong Kong arrives at 4:30am and no hotel will check you in, the BA Arrivals lounge is really useful. I did expect this lounge to be very good at the new T5. Not so, it is not bad, but the American Airlines Lounge at T3 after renovation is better and serves better food. But as I said, it is useful as you are not driven out to wander in the London street in winter time.',\n",
       " \"✅ Verified Review |  When I was invited by a friend to meet in the Concorde Room my expectation levels were high. Unfortunately, while it is nice - it falls short of BA's billing in too many ways. Far too much space has been allocated to the lounging area, which meant that the individual dining tables were cramped. The food was OK and the initial service was fast enough, but the empty plates and glasses stay on the table far too long - over half an hour in our case. The lounge area is richly decorated - which makes the hospital style restrooms a bit of a shock - complete with chipped doors/walls and tired styling. Overall, it's okay, but if you judged the Heathrow Terminal 5 Concorde Room as a hotel, you'd struggle to award it 5 stars. Terminal 5 is great, but BA needs to give the Concorde Room a rethink.\",\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  Very disappointed by the initial appearance of this British Airways Terminal 3 First Class lounge at London Heathrow. First impressions count for a lot but subsequent ones were not much better. Admittedly we had previously been spoiled by the BA LHR T5 Concorde Room lounge. The welcome was insincere, the lighting was dingy and there was no real service unless you ate in the so called restaurant part. Glasses and trash were not picked up in a timely manner, tables were not wiped. This lounge was definitely the poor relation of the T5 lounges. I only wish they would have similar standards across their 2 terminals. Given the choice I would rather not go from T3 (unless I was flying Virgin Atlantic).',\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  Excellent friendly and helpful staff. Well stocked with drinks, cheese, fruit, biscuits, snacks. Kept tidy in the lounge. More care could have taken with maintaining cleanliness in the toilets - although I may just have been unlucky in my timing, since I did see a cleaner going in 10 minutes later. Good electrics hookups for all plug variants kept both me and my daughter (and our technologies) happy!',\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  British Airways has its own lounge in Singapore. The lounge is a good size with plenty of seating and power points. Staff are okay not particularly friendly and did not provide any announcements about the delay in boarding. Gate closed at 19:35 and by 19:30 people began to question if they had missed the boarding call. Had to ask as did many others what was happening only to be told there was a 20 minute delay. Snacks and meals put out where the exact same in November as is December which thankfully was not too bad. WIFI was good and lots of power points to charge devices. Bathroom and showers are good.',\n",
       " 'This Heathrow Terminal 3 lounge has most that you might require - a restaurant, a spa, champagne bar, food and particularly good table wine. There is also lots of space. However, it lacks any pizaz or sparkle and is definitely not the Concorde Room. It can also be a long walk from the gates, but the design of T3 makes this unavoidable.',\n",
       " 'Common lounge for First and Business class passengers meant space was limited. Due to inefficient queues through security and passport control we only had around half an hour in the lounge. With the limited seating and food options and quality it was long enough. Think lukewarm curry and soggy pastries.',\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  My husband and I were looking forward to relaxing in this British Airways lounge at Gatwick Airport before our flight to Cyprus. We were expecting space, choice of food and drinks. How disappointed we were when we walked into a packed lounge with long queues to get an alcoholic drink with hot food and nowhere to sit. The only buffet type food included flapjacks, nuts, fruit ,stale brownies, lemon drizzle cake, tea and coffee. I would expect cold meats, sandwiches, salads, bread rolls, cheese & biscuits etc. It was not at all clear on arrival what queue was for what, no menus to be seen and no one to ask. What a waste of time and money to think this was a lounge with luxury in mind. We would have rather paid for a decent breakfast in one of the main restaurants. It has put us off booking club class again. There was only one toilet outside the lounge. Come on British Airways, do not take your passengers for granted and stop treating us like cattle!',\n",
       " \"As we were flying in BA First from London to Washington, we were invited to use the Concorde Lounge. We experienced excellent service which included complimentary eggs benedict for breakfast and superb champagne (I believe the latter was Laurent-Perrier Grand Siecle). This is the best lounge I've had the opportunity to visit. However, some of the furniture is in need of refurbishment and I was surprised to see worn, torn, stained and chipped items here and there in a lounge of this caliber.\",\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  Terrible food. Stale/dry bread on the sandwiches. Dry cheeses. Tasteless soup. Veges OK. But for a first class lounge, it really needs to step up to other airlines. Feels like a 7-11 convenience store is giving free samples. Terrible. Drink selection is good. Good variety.',\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  I am writing this review from the British Airways Dubai First Class lounge as we have a 2 hour delay on the flight. This is the \"new\" lounge and I agree its \"new\" as I passed though Dubai 14 months ago. I am not sure its an improvement on the old one (at least you could look at planes taxing by) and to be honest - its a complete joke. Passengers pass through the \"Club World\" lounge and are given (oddly) a pass to scan - to gain access to the all new \"Concorde\" lounge. If you ask me whats the difference? - I\\'d say, you tell me. Its a room, about six meters square. In the center it has a marble top Island to seat eight with power sockets. The seats are high stools and very uncomfortable. It has two alcoves which seats 2 persons a apiece. That\\'s fine if you had something decent to eat. One wall has a couple of chillers and there is plenty of booze - including some fizz. Food? Well there is a hot plate and when we asked the floor attendant for some hot food - he said we don\\'t offer it. I said when do you? he said \"never\". On offer was some hummus, sliced carrots, olives, stuffed vine leaves, pickled beans, sun blushed tomatoes, mixed salad, sickly cakes (which nobody touched) nuts, soup ( that came from the Club lounge) bread and some fruit. A coffee machine. That\\'s it folks. Eight winged chairs (same as the Club option) sit around the room - four facing the white out window and the shopping mall and duty free. Ghastly. Uncomfortable. There is no separate toilets to business class. Given the Emirates competition (and Qantas) on this route, logic would tell you (well with BA logic is not on their vocabulary) - you would think they would want to beat them on quality, style and presentation. Three flights a day - with a potential for 40 or so 1st customers - you would think BA would want to stand out. They do - but for all the wrong reasons.',\n",
       " \"✅ Verified Review |  Pretty basic Swissport lounge at Larnaca Airport, food is very poor. A few dried up sandwiches and tiny squares of pizza and that's about it. Not enough power points to go around and the screaming kids does nothing to help one work. There is nothing luxury about this cafe at LCA.\",\n",
       " \"This lounge reminded me more of a good Business Lounge than a First Class Lounge. In peak time it was incredibly full and guests in there did not really know how to behave. I can't usually stand it when somebody puts his feet on a table in a public area or is (nearly) shouting via the phone. Staff was overloaded with work so the Lounge was not the cleanest. It is quite nice that you can have Champagne in there and that there is some food that can be ordered. Nonetheless the real First Class Lounge is probably the Concorde Room.\",\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  A very poor British Airways lounge at Boston Logan Airport, with uncomfortable seating very close together and very few power outlets. Hot and airless with no windows and toilet facilities for men consisting of one toilet and one urinal stall. There is a full restaurant which I did not use. Small selection of food and drink',\n",
       " \"This lounge at Gatwick Airport is quite a nice place and we spent a long time there because our flight was terribly delayed. I was looking forward to a glass of Prosecco but - they had run out - and a glass of champagne was £8. We did not have any food as we were expecting to eat on the plane when it eventually departed. There weren't many free seats in this lounge because of the delay and the most comfortable ones had already been taken. No-one seemed to know how to get wifi in the lounge but luckily someone in the Reception area was able to help us! We found this pretty surprising and no-one knew the right password to get into wifi!! We did eventually get it. It was ok but not great and we have been in better lounges for business travel in other countries in the world which are not nearly as civilised as London.\",\n",
       " '✅ Verified Review |  This tired old British Airways lounge in Heathrow T3 is a disappointment. Other airlines are upping their game with lounge quality and BA is just resting on its laurels. The food selection in the evening is more like a school canteen than a business class lounge. There was a chicken casserole, lukewarm jacket potatoes, grated cheese, along with several empty catering vats that appeared to have once contained a pasta dish and baked beans. Twenty minutes later they were still empty. The drink selection was good. Champagne was available, but only on request and finding a member of staff is quite hard. When I did, they grudgingly headed off to wherever the bottle was locked away. Most tables were cluttered with dirty plates, glasses dishes and rubbish. Dishes and plates don’t clean themselves. There are not enough toilets to cope with the volume of passengers either. Standards are embarrassingly bad. In the end I left and went to the American Airlines lounge in Terminal 3 for some food.',\n",
       " \"British Airways lounge at Johannesburg Airport had a good selection of food and beverage. Temperature was fine. There are not enough charge stations and some seats were uncomfortable. Lounge gets very crowded. Bathroom and showers are not as luxurious as other airline lounges. I don't think I would use British Airways Business Class again. We used Air France Business Class in 2015 and I thought the seating and lounges were much better than British Airways.\",\n",
       " \"The first and business class lounge at Phoenix Airport is not fit for purpose. There is nothing more I can add. It's small, outdated and a real disappointment. It doesn't even have washrooms, let alone a shower. It is a serious disappointment and similar to the 747 which we travelled in. If somebody senior at BA travelled with Etihad, Emirates or many other airlines they would realize very quickly that they are way behind.\",\n",
       " 'British Airways has three lounges at Heathrow. Two are at A Gate, North and South, both are always congested. But it is the B Lounge that I used this time (even I fly from A Gate) and it was excellent. B Gate lounge are mainly used by long haul passengers, and while the food service is the same it was not congested. Thus this time, when I arrived early, I used it even knowing that my flight would depart on a A Gate.',\n",
       " 'This is an excellent lounge. The dining room has a nice meal available with waiter service. On this occasion Steak and chips with a tasty sauce, beautifully cooked with excellent presentation and great service. I like the terrace in this lounge, a nice place to relax. The inside room is much better than the First Class lounge? Not really but the BA First Class lounge is a great place to be. The strict limitations on entry mean the Concorde room is never that busy.',\n",
       " 'Not impressed. Had to wait for plates and wine to be opened by harassed looking staff who could only be apologetic - and frankly school meals are better than the dross that was on offer. Then to be confronted by queues on the way out only reinforced the feeling that this is no premium service. Better save your money and use some of the excellent independent restaurants at Heathrow.',\n",
       " 'This Athens Airport British Airways lounge is a small lounge, space for about 50 people, furniture is more than 20 years old and really needs a refresh. I found it rather warm inside. A small selection of sandwiches and salads. All in all, I found it ok but nothing more than that - no need to go earlier to the airport to enjoy the lounge.',\n",
       " \"This Concorde Room lounge is the best of the BA lounges in T5. If you book a flight in advance, book a private cabana in the lounge for a maximum of four hours, where you can sleep, shower, watch TV, make free phone calls and have room service. There is a dining room for breakfast, lunch and dinner with food and wine menus dotted around the lounge. There is also a Boardroom for internet and printer use, where the chairs are from Concorde. The bar is well stocked with premium drinks and a manned area for your luggage. There are plenty of chairs and sofas to relax in, although some of the furnishings are beginning to look a little tired. It is a great place to start a holiday or business trip, and it's never that crowded when I've visited.\",\n",
       " 'This is the first time I had used the Galleries lounge at JFK, which is also shared with Qantas and ANA passengers as part of the One World alliance. It is good to note though, that only BA Club World passengers are allowed to use the Elemis Spa and the pre-flight supper facility, otherwise it would be impossible to receive any of these services. It is a large, comfortable and clean lounge with showers, PCs, a bar and snacks. A great place to relax before a long flight.',\n",

Outward journey from Gatwick was great. Hotel was great. Arrived at Rome airport to find lounge was closed due to fire back in May 2015 and very limited eating facilities were available and all were full. No gate allocated due to delays, hence no seat. A bad experience waiting over 3 hours with coffee and pastry which BA did not provide. Wrote, emailed and called BA and response was very slow incoming. They confirmed that an email advising that the lounge was unavailable was sent to me. True this was posted out the last night before we left which I didn't retrieve until I got home. BA knew in June 2015 the Lounge was shut due to a fire the previous month. However, they didn't bother to tell me at time I booked holiday. No apology has very been forthcoming.\",\n",

       " 'I have not visited a British Airways Lounge for a few years. The one I visited recently was completely inferior from the last one I visited especially in the food and beverage area. This time, 3rd rate buffet fare, stale rolls and a wine selection from a cheap supermarket. The seating was reasonably comfortable, but seriously in need of a makeover. In summary a 2/5 experience whereas the likes of Emirates and Qatar at Heathrow would be close to 5/5.',\n",

There were a lot of dirty plates and glasses all over the place. The washrooms were probably the worst bit. They were messy, dirty and smelly. The airport toilet were actually much better. The selection of food and drinks were nothing to shout about. In fact, the light meal menu choices (pasta, curry etc) have been unchanged for the last several years. Overall, this is not the worst business lounge I have ever been but don't expect the same quality offered by the premier airlines.\",\n",

The internet is not working properly most time and difficult to make a print out. However I discovered that the lounge at B Gate is much much better. It is never congested and far more comfortably in terms of space ratio. The trouble is that BA dies not announce whether flight is from A or B and you normally go to A.',\n",
       " \"British Airways Club class passengers are being directed to this lounge while the BA business lounge is being refurbished for use by Virgin. According to BA staff at the front desk, No 1 will be the default BA lounge until January 2017, when British Airways will move operations to the South Terminal. Definitely something to bear in mind when choosing a carrier for your next flight, as No1 is a very poor substitute for the old North Terminal business lounge. The lounge is open access, and was very crowded when we used it at around midday on 1st April. A staff member took the trouble to find us seating when we complained. Because of the crowding, the lounge is very noisy. Self service provision of food was very limited, unattractive, and was not renewed quickly enough. Washrooms: there are 3 cubicles in the women's toilets, so inevitable queueing, although the area was clean and well fitted. No showers are available. Poor selection of newspapers and magazines.\",\n",

They also claim it has \"a deli area for light dining and a stylish bar\". The former offers soup, plastic cheese, and crisps. The latter is no more than a counter with a small selection of beverages (no champagne or sparkling wine). No sofas or anything you could recline on, if you were tired. On the plus side it has a nice view of the airfield.',\n",
       " 'I can only concur with earlier reviews of this British Airways Heathrow T3 lounge regarding its poor overall quality and service. I have been in more welcoming bus stations! Food offerings were scant and were also poorly presented without care and attention. I do not expect haute cuisine at all (having used BA lounges before) but there were no dinner plates to place any food items on. When I was there in the early afternoon the only food offerings were rolls, salad, jacket potatoes (no butter) and baked beans. The only plates available were saucer sized (maybe this is their way of persuading people to not eat too much) and the drink can were half sized. Cost cutting is very much in evidence here and it also shows in the attitude of the staff who seemed really miserable. Tables took a long time to be cleared and some of the bins were overflowing. This is not how a lounge should be at all. I used the toilets and found these to be quite clean. I did wonder why the toilet rolls were placed about 6 inches above the ground however; a clear design flaw. BA should take a long and hard look at this lounge and make great strides in improving it. Giving the catering contract to a decent caterer (or use Marks and Spencer to provide food) would be a good start.',\n",
       " 'This tiny British Airways lounge at San Francisco Airport had inadequate, uncomfortable seating and resembled a hospital waiting room. There were nowhere near enough seats for the stream of passengers entering. The poor selection of food that greeted us was a couple of empty platters with some disassembled sandwich remains which was only replenished after I asked (and ran out again in minutes each time it was laid out). The side plates kept running out too, staff were present but seemed to lack energy and speed. Very disappointing given the equally poor temporary arrangements at Gatwick when we flew out. A lackluster beginning and end to our holiday, and a disappointment in our flag carrier airline. We will book with other airlines in future.',\n",
       " \"Was directed into the Gatwick Airport No 1 Traveller lounge as BA's lounge was under refurbishment. Overall, the lounge was lovely. Staff very attentive and friendly. Service was prompt.

       " 'This is a brand new lounge that opened last month in the new Concourse D at DXB. While Concourse D works reasonably well, it is a long walk from this lounge to the gate, as in the past. I prefer the seating layout in their old lounge to this, as all the seats here are arranged in long rows that face each other, with only one corridor being a single row. Food has improved a bit in quality, but the lounge feels more crowded, and no longer offers any tarmac views. The decor is somewhat similar to the lounge at Washington Dulles, but that lounge has an exceptionally good layout and higher quality food, compared to this one. I am surprised that BA downgraded the ambience of this lounge, when Emirates has upgraded their lounges at DXB recently.',\n",
       " 'What a disappointment the new British Airways First Class Lounge is at Dubai Airport, I travelled from there today & the lounge is just not working for me or other first class passengers who were commenting on it too. The lounge is a separate room from the rest of the new Galleries Lounge which has just opened in Terminal D at Dubai Airport. Overall both lounges are much smaller than the old lounge, & the views are internal through some form of frosted glass which you have to stand up to look out of. The first class lounge seating is a joke, not very comfortable & the food is well best left as the variety is very poor. You have a access card given to you when you arrive at the lounge to let you into the first class area, just so pretentious not really required & not wanted. There are no comfortable armchairs or sofas to relax on, just these boutique swivel chairs which are just very uncomfortable. I do not know who designed this lounge but I am sure they have never flown before or used a lounge before, they need to scrap the lot & start again as it is not working & no doubt cost a fortune to be designed by a clueless student. If you are going to use the new first class lounge then set your expectations very low.',\n",

It is completely the opposite end of the terminal to passport control. I have been using this lounge for over 3 years and have had cause to complain on numerous occasions. The food selection has remained the same in all this while, often dry sandwiches and a few pastries regardless of time of day. I regularly have to ask for ice, quite often to be told it is in the other lounge, (there are two separate lounges divided by the reception). On one occasion there was no coffee available at 6.00 in the morning for the first flight. This flight also means that the food service has not been stocked or cleaned from the previous day. I have not once seen a BA staff member checking the establishment. There are no spare electrical sockets for charging, one must remove a lamp. The toilets often smell and are often unclean. Despite complining to BA and being assured that the matter will be resolved, it has not. British Airways, I have a choice using Emirates.',\n",

       " \"The transfer of British Airways LHR-Phoenix flight from T5 to T3 gave hope that with it would come a bright, shiny business lounge. Alas, that hasn't happened. The impression you get is that the airline is trying to do more with less, cramming as many people into a small space as they can and getting away with providing a few nondescript snacks to keep the masses fed. The reality is that British Airways has outdone even the tatty T5 lounges in stripping away any vestiges of comfort and it is a reason not to enjoy (or should that be 'endure') pre-flight relaxation in there. Dirty plates, glasses, cups and cutlery are left laying on surfaces for ages, the carpet and upholstery is already grubby and stained, and I swear there is more food on the carpets than on the servery. As an airline, BA is fast slipping down the league table and what was always considered a premier airline is now nothing more than an expensive middle of the road haulier. They should invest in staff who at least hold the customer in more than thinly-veiled contempt, as once you get past reception you are unlikely to see a smiling face. I'll still fly their LHR-PHX route each month but will avoid the lounge in future, instead putting myself at the mercy of the general concourse. It's got to be better, safer and more hygienic.\",\n",

Some of these may be undergoing refurbishment for the Olympics, but the general impression was of terminal decline. Everything about the lounge is shabby, from the state of the carpet to the food and drink on offer. It's shared with other airlines, so it becomes extremely busy when there are a number of late evening flights departing. Wine is limited to a single choice of red and white. The food options are lamentable. Trying to find somewhere to plugin a laptop proved ridiculous as sockets were either not working or other passengers had unplugged extension leads to plug in their own equipment. Bizarrely there wasn't a single screen in the lounge displaying the status of departures, meaning that one was totally reliant on the staff at reception who seemed uninterested in keeping passengers informed. God help those using the lounge during the Olympics. The lounge is a shocker.\",\n",

The room is small, service was non-existent, food on offer was basic. As the morning flight for Heathrow departs shortly after 9 am, I tend to skip breakfast at the hotel so would have welcomed something decent at the lounge. There were cereals, juice, some unappetizing looking hot food, bowls of fresh fruit salad, some filled rolls, cashew nuts and the ubiquitous crisps. The offering made the Little Chef (motorway cafes style) look upmarket. There were alcoholic drinks but didn't sample them so cannot comment on their quality. Even the toilets were basic: 2 cubicles in the female toilet, be prepared to queue. Choice of English newspapers were limited to the Daily Mail and sometimes The Times. Wifi was painfully slow. All in all, a functional and utilitarian experience.\",\n",

It was very crowded on a Saturday morning, with hardly an empty seat, 20 minutes before boarding time (for London Heathrow). The choice of food was interesting - plenty of sweets including Ferraro Rocher. The tub of crudities I picked looked fresh and tasted fresh - far better than the snack offered on board BA economy class. There seemed to be a good choice of food and drink. Only one ladies toilet inside the lounge so queuing was inevitable. Mid-range for a frequent traveller lounge.',\n",

Drinks are fine, but the champagne is mid priced and not very inspired.   Staff are fine. Its all part of the First package and compared with airlines such as Singapore Airlines (we were on the way to Singapore), it falls well short of the mark in what I feel the overall \"First Class\" experience should be. Shame really. With a bit of effort from BA it could be fantastic.',\n",

The lounge was pretty busy with not many seats to be found, but we found one eventually and had a drink. Our flight was delayed and we kept checking the board, but no gate available. All other flights were showing their gates etc. We eventually got bored of waiting and left the lounge only to find that our flight was closing and there must have been a fault in the lounge with the display. We had to run through the airport and when we arrived, they told us the flight was closed and that our bags were being offloaded. I think they took pity on us however as they allowed us to board, but we've never seen our suitcase since.\",\n",

Fairly untidy. Floor in less than pristine condition. Went to the ladies restroom to freshen up and as soon as entering, staff member pointed a finger at an open door and said \"That one\". I helped the man who came to clear the debris, previously left on the table we had to use, by moving cups, etc. across the wide table, saying, \"that might help\", only to be met with stony silence. British Airways have some serious issues with unenthusiastic, uncommunicative staff (to add to their other problems) - maybe they aren\\'t appreciated. After the difficulty and time it took for BA to accept that our full business tickets (booked via another airline, involving three legs on different airlines inc BA) entitled us to entry to their lounge (a matter which will be taken further with BA), we only had time for a quick freshen and a glass of water before our gate opened for our next BA \"experience\".',\n",

The magazine selection was sparse and the food choices were fine but not the ability to sit in a separate dining area with hot food as in JFK. I was flying from Prague and the allocated time to get from one terminal to another at Heathrow was so lengthy, even through the fast lanes - that myself and other travelers barely had time to grab a bite to eat and run and board. It was poor planning of connecting flights and other Americans flying BA from Prague via Heathrow to JFK said the same thing. No tea sandwiches, or other choices - the time of arrival is when it seems to be very basic in snacks, food for a meal and no tea sandwiches. And too early for wine - Dishes were left to be picked up and the host of the lounge when I arrived was lacking in skills of courteous service. I could have been in a Food Court sadly. I do not understand why it appears that British Airways do not care as much anymore - which is sad, because I have always been a loyalist.',\n",

It was large and more crowded with buffet food. So we went back to the Concorde lounge and asked reception why they had two lounges and she explained that ours was for exclusive use of First Class passengers whilst the First Class lounge was in reality just a frequent flyer facility. Confusing or what? Nothing too flash about the Concorde Room, just a relaxing place to prepare for you flight.',\n",

Bar staff miserable - perhaps not treated very well I suspect (Qantas sponsored lounge). I actually left and got a beer I'd heard of (and liked) across the corridor outside - sad to have to do.  A few other passengers had previously mentioned this to us, but said you need to see it. Copy T5's example. Food ok. At least there was hot food with butter chicken, although not chicken breast.

All breakfasts are cleared apparently by 9.30am, with no eggs, bacon, sausages etc available - even on request. The place was packed as expected and we were not alone in this feeling.

Very hard to find a clean seat or an area where there were no dirty dishes, leftover food and crumbs on the floor. It took a staff member 50 minutes to remove the used dishes, I don’t know how long they were there before we arrived; they removed the dishes and wiped all the crumbs on to the floor - it was only about 9pm that I saw a staff member with a vacuum cleaner. I think that was because it was due to close up for the night soon; I would have been willing to pay the 30 pounds for access to one of the privately owned lounges we have used before. ',\n",

In comparison with other lounges to the likes of The Pier in Hong Kong, and the Qatar Airways lounge in Doha, this British Airways lounge is more Premium Economy than First. It's a perfectly nice place to pass the time before your flight. The lounge is very spacious so a lot of seating on offer, but there are many times where space is limited as the lounge does get very crowded. I love the self service champagne Bar they have. The food section is a massive let down. When I compare to the Club Lounge, the selection of food on offer is far more limited. My recent visit was in the morning and to give them their credit the selection was very good and there as a lot on offer. Other times I have used the lounge at dinner with limited choices. They have menus so you are able to place your food order with a member of staff, but again very limited options, and portions so small, you feel hungry after eating. One major letdown I find is their bathrooms - when you leave the nice surroundings of the lounge to use the bathroom facilities, you really feel where they cut some costs, and its a huge let down from the rest of the lounge. The lounge is okay, not show stopping like what is on offer in some Asian Airports, but a perfectly acceptable place to pass the time.\",\n",

The washrooms were clean. Computer terminals and free Wi-Fi are offered, along with magazines and newspapers. The lounge was fairly full due to the aircraft being the A380, plus being also used by Oneworld / Executive Club members. However, there were seats available and it didn't feel overcrowded.

       " \"The old BA lounge at Schipol was small, cramped, had a poor selection of food and the staff were indifferent at best and unfriendly at worst.  The new lounge has managed to retain all of those things, with an added 15 minute walk through a temporary tunnel from the terminal building. The only positive things I can say about this place is that the air conditioning works, and it wasn't too crowded when I visited.  I have visited BA and partner lounges worldwide.  This one is the worst by miles. Not recommended, obviously.\",\n",
       " \"New but cramped and uninviting. No pc's so if you don't have a laptop its a 15 minute trek back though the airport to find the internet facility. No information boards and staff offer no information unless asked. No update announcements. I arrived for a 6.50 pm flight and it was already known that there was at least a three hour delay but this was not mentioned ( the aircraft was still on the ground at AMS and had to do a rotation to Gatwick and back before our flight ). The flight eventually took off at midnight - during that time there were no announcements no apology and passengers were sharing information they gleaned by questioning the staff at the desk Even when they called the flight at 10.45 - presumably to turf us out of the lounge - after a 10 minute walk to the gate we found the aircraft was still disembarking. No offer of food vouchers during the 5 hour delay and the small plate of sandwiches soon disappeared around 7 pm leaving us with crisps or crackers. Really not good enough and should be scored zero for comfort food and service\",\n",

Nice lounge large and pleasantly decorated with comfortable chairs and good position for plane spotters! We arrived around 1pm there was a small but nice fresh salad bar soup various sandwiches and fruit nuts crisps all constantly replenished the only sweet things were biscuits next to the coffee as we were leaving at 6pm it seemed hot food was being served. A good selection of wines spirits soft drinks juices tea coffee you need to ask for Champagne and I did a lot!! Staffs were all very pleasant & helpful. If you require power points the only ones I could see were at the back of the lounge in the corner opposite the wines & spirits. Personally I think there should have been some more 'dotted' about as most people require them.\",\n",

Overcrowded hot poor food lame selection of drinks inconsistent internet and a location which is remarkably inconvenient this is lounge to miss. Staff? What staff! No-one showed an interest and little action to clean refresh the food or make us feel welcome. Quite why BA continue with it I am not sure - I can only assume that none of their staff have used it.',\n",

The T3 lounge is very good - a wide range of different sitting spaces great views of the runways and aircraft delightful staff and a very strong range of drinks. Relaxed and welcoming. The minus is that the food offering has remained the same for at least 2 years and is modest in its range and quality - disappointing.',\n",

The wifi was a bit slow and dropped quite frequently. Interestingly there were quite a few birds yes birds in the lounge that made it feel quite exotic. Obviously not a feature but watching the sing and fly around my head did make me smile. The lounge was between gates 22 and 26 and our gate was 11. Which did mean a bit of a schlep to the gate!',\n",

I let them have my thoughts and they did call me. They assured me the lounge was going to have a multi million pound refurbishment - great but it doesn't help me and as I pointed out why is the lounge allowed to fall into this state of disrepair?\",\n",

       " 'There\\'s nothing like a good lounge before your flight to make things easier - and this is nothing like a good lounge. It is the worst lounge I\\'ve ever used. Having said that it isn\\'t quite as bad as some other reviews across the Internet might lead you to believe. We arrived about 90 minutes before our British Airways flight from Bordeaux to London Gatwick and the whole Club Europe check-in process was very friendly and smooth. We were issue with an invitation to the lounge; you then have to go through security (no fast track of course!) and present your invitation to the \"Cafe News\" on the airside. They will then give you the code for the lounge\\'s front door. You have to enter this yourself; the lounge has no staff at all. However the member of staff at the cafe was very pleasant. There is a vending machine serving hot drinks which I found acceptable but be aware that the default choice adds sugar to everything which I did not want. There are a couple of local wines in a cooler and various spirits with soft drinks and mixers in the cooler. A few food items are available; in our case since we had a morning flight there were some quite fresh croissants and pains au chocolat which were actually quite good. The seating is rather old but not uncomfortable. The lounge itself was mercifully quiet which I suspect is usually the case for what is most probably a mainly holiday destination. Some of the tables could have used a quick clean but nothing serious here. So all in all if you can get a good price for your business class seat it may be worth it for the additional pre-flight comfort but anything like standard business class prices are definitely more than it\\'s worth paying for this lounge.',\n",

Do bare in mind that the 25 minute treck is just to get the new lounge you will need to add at least 40 minutes to get to the departure gates & through security. The new lounge appears to have less seats than the old lounge it is narrow & cramped & you still need to leave the lounge to use washroom facilities. The refreshments are very poor nothing as improved in this area so still a very poor selection of drinks & food & snacks. The furnishings are trendy as opposed to being comfortable & functional as well as being cramped with little privacy if you want to have your own space. At the moment I would not entertain visiting the British Airways lounge until the building work has been completed towards the end of 2015 as it is not worth the effort it takes to reach the lounge after check in or leave the lounge to get to the departure gate. Once again British Airways have missed the boat on redesigning something which could be wonderful for their passengers.',\n",

Lots of seating was available so we picked a couple of seats with power outlet. The seats were well maintained clean and comfortable. A couple of ladies came around frequently to clear dishes and we found them very pleasant. Food was a nice potato and leek soup and sandwiches. Sandwiches weren't the best. Good selection of refreshments. Would happily return.\",\n",

I went to the ladies loo which had a long queue but very clean - and for a shower which I did not have to wait for which were clean and very good. Sadly the lounges area seems to be full to bursting on most occasions when I visit - it used to be a quiet relaxing lounge but on two occasions I have left and used my Priority Pass for the quieter No.1 Lounge downstairs. BA really need to enlarge this lounge as it really doesn't cope with the volume of passengers using it anymore. The staff are always helpful but there does need to be more of them in busy periods. The food is of very good quality and choice (much better than on the flights).\",\n",

I have travelled extensively on business and generally have a far better experience with Emirates or Singapore Airlines. Even the Lufthansa lounge at Heathrow has a better ambience. BA need to take the time to give this place a much needed uplift. If customers paying premium fares help BA survive more needs to be done to ensure they don't go looking for the premium service they pay for elsewhere.\",\n",

Have they had a pay cut as they appear seriously unhappy and make an effort to be difficult and offhand to us paying customers. Sadly this is something I have noted onboard as well during last 2 long haul flights to Chengdu and back. Product is well below Asian airline competitors and Lufthansa and Air France are ahead of BA in the business class game. Amenities catering and service onboard Club World are a joke and I guess the only satisfied travellers are those who have never flown other airlines apart from BA.',\n",

I've used plenty of the major airline's first class lounges: Qantas Cathay Emirates American etc: and considering this is the First Class lounge at BA's flagship terminal; I was pretty unimpressed. Firstly the breakfast was awful. The scrambled eggs on the buffet were more milk than egg. The coffee was out of a machine: no trained Barista and the menu that was available was very limited. I also had to queue for the toilets: not a shower. Just the toilets. Maybe this can happen in the business lounge but you just wouldn't expect this in first. Then it's the little things. I sat in quite a comfy seat with decent views but I could not charge my phone as there was no USB amenities. Also they had international power outlets but not Australian/New Zealand and I had already packed my adapters in my checked baggage. These are the type of small items that with a little thought can make a big difference to one's comfort whilst travelling. Sorry BA but you've failed. I'd look at what Cathay Pacific have done in Hong Kong and Qantas in Sydney. I love the Qantas first lounge in Sydney but Cathay's first class lounge in Hong Kong is spectacular.\",\n",

The dramatic improvement in internet is also noteworthy - no longer the inappropriate scratchcard system and now good quality wifi to which you can connect direct. Helpful staff and wonderful views. Excellent - well done on the improvements.',\n",
       " \"BA has no control over this lounge as it is shared. Unbelievable that a brand new terminal would have shared facilities. It is an open bland fairly uninteresting space with a section 'cordoned' off for First Class pax. Food and drink the same for everybody. What is totally ludicrous is that in a brand new lounge in a brand new terminal there is only one men's and one women's toilet. Utterly inadequate.\",\n",

The drinks selection was very good the comfort certainly good and it was a busy though comfortable atmosphere.Not that easy to find it is friendly enough. The wifi issue is a considerable downside and the food was simply not plentiful enough - long periods without anything other than chips/crisps and then narrow range. Drinks - of all types - were plentiful and good quality. Seating was comfortable though the lack of power sockets was a little surprising.',\n",

Seats arranged in long functional rows along the walls - no different from the departure lounges. I normally fly Qatar or Emirates - they both know how to do Business Class -BA has either lost it's way or lost interest. It's been dumbed down to accommodate silver/gold card economy travellers. Fly Qatar or Emirates - even the Virgin Upper Class lounge is better than this.\",\n",

       " 'This is a fairly small and somewhat claustrophobic lounge. The chairs are comfortable enough. There is just about enough choice of drinks (no Campari) but an extremely limited choice of \"nibbles\" or anything else to eat. Also a very limited choice of newspapers - no Daily Telegraph for example. Our Amsterdam lounge experience was made singularly unpleasant by several lounge users conducting business into their mobile telephones at the top of their voices. After over half an hour of this anti-social behaviour my wife got up and told them that they were making so much noise she was unable to concentrate on the book she was reading. This lounge needs an area reserved for those who wish to utilise mobile telephones at the top of their voices! We were glad to leave the lounge.',\n",

What a nightmare. I am a disabled passenger but I was not allowed to walk through the Concord area to the Business Lounge - I was not amused. Certainly a user-unfriendly route from fast-track to the lounge. The Business Lounge is large and busy but looks increasingly \"tired\". They have stopped providing the Daily Telegraph and at the drinks area they have stopped providing Campari. The chairs and carpets appear very \"well-used\" and some of them appear to be well beyond their \"sell-by\" dates. Food provided was so-so - good croissants but uninspiring lunch choices. When this lounge opened it was wonderful. Today it does not hold a candle to the First Concorde lounge (which I have also used on eleven occasions). Although I recommend the lounge it is with some reservations.',\n",

Three parts: the dining area - discreet cubicles with fast service and excellent food; a main lounge with various types of chairs to suit all needs; and a 'veranda' like place that although it is inside has excellent views across the tarmac. Seating here is more like a conservatory. (Spa and showers computer/business room but I didn't try any of these). Well worth getting to the airport 2hrs before your flight. Wifi a bit slow but adequate.\",\n",

In the end I went to the Qantas lounge - you are allowed there and they were wonderful - they have a chef to cook for you. BA's lounge is a disgrace no views of the apron - only of arrival lounge/immigration. Haphazard boarding meant long queues and no fast-track so a long wait at the gate security.\",\n",

I realize that lounges get busy at certain times of day but I don't understand why conditions need to be worse than at your average Starbucks or even (on this occasion) Café Rouge. I suggested to BA that they give me a refund. They said they valued my loyalty but no. Oh well. Fortunately the flight was good but I am assuming lounges are taken into consideration when evaluating airlines for stars and recent lounge experiences have made me wonder if BA's four stars might be too generous.\",\n",

The service for anything from a full meal to a glass of water is waiter only. Empty glasses and used plates were waiting to be cleared from a lot of the tables. As I had only recently eaten on the inbound flight I did not bother to order any food but still tried one of the booths in the dining area which seemed reasonably comfortable and private. I moved to sit 'outside' on the balcony overlooking the departures area as it felt less claustrophobic.

Unfortunately my first experience was at one of the lounges at Ben Gurion. It was small crowded and oppressively stuffy. The decor was straight out of the 70s; huge dimly lit lampshades shiny brown worn polyester seat covers and chrome and smoked glass coffee tables adorned with sticky glass rings which was odd since the rest of the terminal seemed quite new. Once I found a seat I was reluctant to leave it unattended but eventually went to the refreshments counter where I eventually found a lukewarm bottle of beer but no suitable glasses. There was food on offer as well but I gave it a miss as I did with the other facilities preferring to go back out into the main departure area which in comparison was bright clean and refreshingly air conditioned. To be fair to BA though the lounge appears to be shared by many airlines so they probably don't have much influence over how its run.

No cheese no eggs just lots of toast and low quality croissants. The food bar is not well maintained and everything reeks of cheapness and cost cutting from the biscuits and crisps to the wine selection. I asked for cheese and was rudely told there's none available before noon if then. The toilets are often smelly and not clean enough. There is often a queue to get in. It's a shame BA don't realize how this damages their brand. They've been cutting down on meals on board too of course but in the lounges it's really apparent. Hardly worth paying the extra fares; better to save the money and take your own high quality comestibles perhaps.\",\n",

However: after over an hour in here we are getting the first sign of a cleaner; food is almost non existent (I mean this literally!) and the range and quality of drinks has declined over time. Inattentive staff the frustrating wifi system of getting scratchcards every 30 minutes and the paucity of refreshments leaves this well below bar.

The lounges are always busy but there are plenty of seats of many types. The showers are excellent staffed by such friendly ladies and whilst there is often a queue to use the toilets they are spotlessly clean. Good choice of food of sandwiches salads and hot items. The lentil and bean curry was spicy and excellent as was the Thai red curry. Two types of perfectly cooked rice or baked potato. Wide range of alcoholic drinks. The wifi is free easy to log on and of good enough speed despite many people using it. And a great view over airport. I always look forward to coming here.',\n",

The hot food surprisingly for me and very strange for foreign visitors was pea soup! That was all - and some weird croutons. Uninspiring salad bar with no 'wow' factor whatsoever and three types of freshly-made sandwiches - ham and cheese chicken prawn with rose-marie sauce. All of them sorry to say utterly tasteless! The good news is thank goodness the excellent wines available and Champagne (for that you have to ask an over-worked but smiling waitress who will eventually bring it to where you are sitting) Usual premium spirits selection with mixers. Toilets (men) were frankly a bit grubby and dated and a tad smelly - not good enough! More like a traditional English pub on a Saturday night. Overall very underwhelmed with the whole experience and compared with other business class lounges at Heathrow and overseas in Middle East down at the bottom of the list - desperately needs upgrading to bring in line with competitors.\",\n",
       " 'I visited this lounge on 24 May 2014. Warm and pleasant welcome on arrival to the lounge. The main lounge is effectively a rectangle with a small annex to one side with some additional seating and tables. Decent selection of English and French language newspapers but a more limited selection of magazines. Wifi worked well - it was easy to connect and I was pleased with the speed. The lounge was relatively quiet when I visited and had a pleasant quiet atmosphere. A menu was available on the food counter but the food selection is fairly limited - all cold food with some meat and some cheese sandwiches available along with nuts crisps cakes fruit and biscuits - I personally thought that although the selection was limited this was satisfactory given that it is a short haul outpost language. Luggage storage available. Toilet located outside lounge. Overall a pleasant (albeit not amazing) place to spend an hour before a flight.',\n",

All food served in this lounge is waiter service and menus are scattered around the lounge for you to choose your selection from and change depending on the time of day. If you visit the First Galleries Lounge opposite the Concorde Room you can request items from their buffet selection and they will be served to you in the Concorde Room. There was a good choice of premium spirits and champagnes as well as teas coffees and soft drinks. I booked one of the private cabanas when I organised my trip which is a dedicated day room with bed TV shower toilet free telephone use and room service. You can request a cabana for a maximum of four hours it's an oasis of calm within an oasis of calm. I also had lunch and afternoon tea there good quality food and friendly and efficient service. I also used the Elemis Spa facilities which can be booked twenty eight days in advance if you are a First passenger. There is also a boardroom style facility to log on to the internet and printers so you need to produce any paperwork. My only criticism is that some of the soft furnishings are beginning to wear slightly.\",\n",

       " 'Rome Fiumicino Arrivals Terminal is a nightmare but International Departures Terminal Four is state of the art. Even on the busiest weekend of the year—canonization of John Paul II and John XIII—the space was remarkably civilized. The terminal raised expectations for the executive lounge. We were flying Turkish Airlines - in Rome they use British Airways executive lounge. The lounge size is adequate but not much was done with it. Apart from a series of good abstract prints and a series of photographs of architectural details of Rome the space is clinical. Solid blocks of rectilinear grey-beige vinyl sofas and matching chairs suggest that travelers necessarily move in groups of ten -–the squares are intimidating for parties of one or two but once these islands are occupied even by a single traveler they become impenetrable by others. One side of the space is plate glass blindingly bright so only half of the seating cells can be comfortably occupied. Especially for travellers suffering from jet lag the initial unsettling affect of the anti-intimate seating and hyper lighting is subtly exacerbated of other details of the ambiance. The floor carpeted in a non-descript blue felt-like substance is not as might be expected flat. Rather it rises and falls in just such a way as to make you stumble. Internet connection is available but requires an inordinately complex set of interventions to access. Once acquired it is difficult to find one of the few plugs that is not already being used by another harried voyager. The culinary experience like the digital environment is disconcerting. We were arrived at 1 p.. lunchtime. Cereal and yogurt was on offer as well as croissants and cookies. Breakfast apparently lasts all day at the BA lounge. There was a self-serve bar which included red and white wine. The red came in a Bordeaux bottle but it tasted like it had been decanted from a box. Our empty glasses stayed with us during the entirety of our wait.',\n",
       " \"Absolutely shocking. Stale and tasteless lumps of bread. Food in fact that I would be more likely to throw out. Disinterested staff. Without doubt with regards to the food on offer this was the worst I'd ever been to. Nothing to do with British Airways incidentally. We were given access by means other than our airline tickets.\",\n",

       " \"The worst business lounge I've ever seen. There is little food available; what there was consisted of a few different small cakes (I think) packaged snacks and mixed nuts. There is a reasonable selection of drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic but the ice was in an open ice bucket and mostly melted; dried-up slices of lemon on a plate. There is no separate bathroom; you have to use the general public ones outside the lounge. The decor is a particularly unpleasant shade of pale purple. All in all it's a most unwelcoming prospect.\",\n",
       " 'At OSL BA uses the OSL lounge (owned by airport authorities). I often take the late BA flight to LHR after work. If hungry eat somewhere else - food and beverages are below standard for BA lounges. Decent selection of newspapers. Best feature: The lounge is wonderfully quiet. So worth visiting after long day at work to wind down before the flight. Very comfortable chairs and sofas (though not particularly modern or elegant) and a quiet atmosphere. I like it. About 10 mins walk to BA gates from lounge.',\n",
       " 'The quality of the food is dropping every time I spend some times in this lounge. Chilli con carne without proper rice ice cream fridge empty quality of wine getting lower and lower. I also found surprising that nothing is done in the last year to fix some power sockets that do not work (next to seat or on the PC table). It seems that BA believe that quality of service is not important for the price of ticket you have to pay. Maybe they will have a wake-up call like Lufthansa when people will fly different airlines.',\n",

It is cramped not just at peak times and BA seem to have become complacent about improving this. Toilets can be very risky unless you catch at the moment they have just been cleaned and often filthy and unpleasant. Food is at Travelodge level (UK travellers will know what I mean) and fails to match standards at some better European airline lounges. Staff at reception only want to see a card or boarding pass and I think these must be the ones that didn't make the grade at charm school. Don't get me wrong I like BA but their lounge standards (including First) here at Terminal 5 are now poor.\",\n",

On my last visit just before New Year cups and glasses took a relative age to be removed and the food choices seemed less than usual along with having to queue to use the toilet.

It's got to the point where I've ended up at the Espresso cafe at the very end of the southern part of T5.\",\n",

I was flying British Airways and it is to be hoped that they will try to persuade the airport to improve this lounge. Small in size basic in furnishings poorly lit. One bottle of wine only in the whole lounge and a choice of one type of beer. Snacks with very little choice and poor quality. Lavatories were outside of the lounge. Unhelpful staff.',\n",

I was publicly humiliated with his loud out burst for what I thought to be a small crime! The staff member was rude arrogant and had zero customer service skills I would like to name and shame but feel this would lower me to his level. On our quick exit I did point out to him that I had seen numerous other clients taking stock from the lounge but this observation was ignored. BA have responded to my complaint stating that they have passed my concerns onto the LGW management team.',\n",

Comfortable large bright with natural light and excellent view of the runway - huge glass front the lounge which extends along its whole length. Reception is friendly and professional.

       " \"I received complimentary use of this lounge when I took an Iberia flight that connected in NY. I heard that BA has great lounges so I was looking forward to it. It was a letdown to say the least. I was greeted to 3 stale inch-wide sandwich slivers on a tray set off to the side. Bottles of water had not been replenished. I was starving and asked they would be replenishing food/drinks etc. I was told that everything would arrive around 6 - when I asked this question it was about 2 pm. It was also extremely hot in the lounge; hot to the point where certainly something must have been wrong with their air systems. Pay for use of this lounge? Not a chance. In fact you'd have to pay me.\",\n",

       " \"Busy but not over-full. I arrived for some lunch snacks before 1455 Marrakech departure. I'm vegetarian so it would be appreciated if the sandwiches could be labelled. Plenty of salad options and quiche or soup but plates are a bit on the small side. Alcoholic drinks available on a self-service basis but it appeared a glass of fizz was available if you asked for it (I saw it being carried out to people). The big drawback about this lounge is that it doesn't have enough power points. The only ones I could find were situated next to seats right round the L shaped lounge to the left. Also it's not clear to passengers where the toilets are if you miss them on the way in. Loads of people are left wandering aimlessly around the computer area only to have walk back all the way round to the entry/exit. Signs? The coffee is still excellent from the machine - why it's so foul onboard Club Europe is anyone's guess. My only other moan is that unless you're a frequent flyer from LGW it's not clear how far the gate is from the lounge. No map on the mobile app nor anything in the Highlife magazine. Gate 54 appeared and I wasn't sure if I had to walk all the way over that irritating airbridge which adds another 10 minutes to your journey.\",\n",

On the plus side the lounge is calm airy comfortable and has great views of the tarmac. On the other hand staff were indifferent and insufficiently aware of the needs of the \"buffet\" station. The food itself was barely okay. Selection and quality were narrow. The \"hot\" dishes most certainly were not and I worried about that. Wine selection was also okay. House selection(s) were Canadian brands. Was it worth $85CAD+? No.',\n",

It was about midday and there was a full and extensive salad buffet with cold cuts. There was also a selection of sandwiches. The wide drinks selection is there. But the sheer volume of passengers makes it like a January sale. BA has removed a number of flights from Gatwick and moved them to Heathrow and halved the floor space of its lounge as a result. However the remaining floor space isn't enough for the flights still operating from Gatwick. So expect crowds empty food trays no drink glasses and occupied showers. Rest assured that the sandwiches will never be stale - they are never available long enough to get that way.\",\n",

I also tried to JAL lounge it was more spacious but BA had better drink and marginally better food.\",\n",

It is not a pleasant experience and compares unfavourably to the Virgin lounge at Heathrow by some distance. It's hard to find any privacy in these lounges. The food at best is of average quality and I am unsurprised to read that the Food Standards Agency has ordered improvements in basic hygiene levels in these lounges. I'm afraid I too myself off to the Eat cafe for coffee. I felt the £1.75 I paid there was better value and certainly the coffee was better. Shame on you BA.

Unless you have your 5000 frequent flier tier points to get a Concorde Room Card all gold and silver card holders use the galleries lounges meaning this one is much more quiet and peaceful. Staff did a good job keeping the lounge clean but sometimes this meant that they took a bit too much time to fulfill passenger's requests. Although they definetly did not outdo themselves in terms of the restroom/shower quality they did a good job with it and I found each well kept. Business center had pretty fast Internet and wifi worked well. Although the food options offered were all very tasty one thing I disliked about this lounge was that those options were pretty limited and other than a few main course choices there were only light snacks available upon request. Overall I think Britsh Airways took a good risk by not making this lounge extremely large and instea d putting their focus on the quality of the area and I would definetly visit again and recommend it to others.\",\n",
       " \"The only downside to this lounge is that it doesn't open until 4pm for the evening flights (I am not sure if it is open in the morning for the morning flight out of JFK) so if you have a long layover chances are you will have to spend some time in the Galleries First and Terraces Lounges which are nice but don't touch the quality of this lounge. A very tranquil and peaceful area British Airways has made sure there are almost too many staff members so that while food is prepared the lounge is cleaned etc. there are also staff available to help with anything you need. When dinner is available the quality and choice of food is fantastic and there is a wide selection of snacks available upon request when in search of something lighter. The wifi works well and there are also 3 computers in the back. A small quiet room that could easily be missed provides a nice place to relax. The only negative to this lounge is that the spa/shower rooms are not in the Lou ge so to take a shower I had to walk across the terminal and into the Business class lounge but it's a small terminal so it's not that bad. Overall this has to be one of my favorite lounges in the world and I actually prefer it over the Concorde room at London Heathrow.\",\n",

The glass tube shaped terminal building offers nice tarmac views from this lounge. The food service is merely average most of the day but the beverage service is quite good. A dinner buffet was served much too late for the \"Sleeper Service\" flight. BA does this to exclude the CX customers who share the lounge but it gives BA passengers only about an hour prior to boarding leaving very little time for flexibility.

Orders not fulfilled in the bar area or the 'terrace'. Carpets stained and the whole room looking tired. Elmis spa has no dedicated area for First in fact we couldn't get in - as priority is 'first come' rather than First then Business. Overall don't use this lounge and T5 as any kind of reason to fly British Airways!\",\n",

I eventually went up to the bar myself but the one guy was busy filling orders for the waitresses and I had to wait to catch his attention. I saw no food except for the food served in the dining area. Next time we will go to the Galleries Lounge and help ourselves.\",\n",
       " \"The BA lounge at Warsaw airport is located after Immigration control on the lower level. A fairly quiet lounge with hot and cold drinks available but a poor selection of snacks. Crisps and nuts seem to make up BA's choice of food in Warsaw although a few stale bread rolls were available with cheese. The lounge offers a basic product.\",\n",
       " 'Late morning flight to Heathrow. I found the lounge relatively easily. Warm welcome limited flight information in the lounge but flight was called in plenty of time (40 minutes prior) and boarding had only just started when we arrived. Travelling to the gate (G12) involved using a shuttle/train so it is worth giving yourself plenty of time. Lounge very spacious. Newspapers available but no English language magazines. Food limited but - too late for breakfast and too early for lunch. Catering consisted of crisps nuts fruit and a few pastries. Coffee machine broken. Beer on tap but another passenger commented that the barrel needed to be changed. Plenty of alcohol available including prosecco. Luggage storage space available. Toilets decent and within lounge.',\n",
       " 'Mid morning flight to Rome a reasonably warm welcome at the front desk. Decent selection of newspapers and magazines. The lounge was very busy and it was a struggle to find 2 seats in particular ones surrounded by used glasses plates and cups. Wi-fi was difficult to connect to although more the fault of myself and my iPad. Password readily displayed and there is a a guide in the lounge for iPad users. Champagne available on request and (unusually) freely available in the bar area. Selection of basic breakfast items juices and snacks. There is very limited hot food available in this lounge. Toilets very clean.',\n",
       " 'We had some difficulty finding this lounge; on our first attempt at following the \"VIP\" signs we ended up at a different lounge where we could have stayed but we were advised that there was another lounge much closer to our gate which was in fact the case. It\\'s a comfortable lounge and it didn\\'t seem too busy even on a Friday evening. There are different types of seating including desks and tables as well as a lot of very comfortable armchairs. There is a very nice rest area which is kept in semi- darkness with beds where you can take a nap. There are plenty of drinks available including wines spirits coffee and various soft drinks. The food is a little disappointing consisting of a small range of sandwiches (a fresh batch was delivered while we were there and they seemed quite freshly made) and various other snacks. Nothing more substantial is available. There seems to be no more than 15 minutes of free wifi available which is rather disappointing for a business lounge. Together with the poor signage towards the lounge and the obvious lack of airport staff in general for the first- time visitor this lounge gets an average score from us. If you know where it is already then you may find it better. We did enjoy the chance to relax for a couple of hours before our departure though.',\n",
       " \"The lounge is a bit tired and Wi-Fi access is via a password at the reception area. In terms of refreshments the lounge has to be the worst I have ever experienced. Snacks were just about it and they were few and far between. There was a large basket of biscuit for cheese but no cheese on offer. When I enquired about this at reception I was curtly told “we offer sandwiches from 3pm. That's it!” I entered the lounge at 12:30pm. Some beer spirits and wine were available but not a great selection. There are no toilets in the lounge so to go you have to take everything with you and it's a trek!\",\n",
       " 'What a disappointment. Canteen style food. Food served in metal canteen holders were a fitting receptacle for clumps of penne pasta and tomato sauce. Cheese served in the same metal container chunks of cheddar and indifferent blue. No wonder the majority were feasting on Kettle Chips as the only fresh oasis in a sea of processed food. We were tempted to slip next door to the One where we knew we could order a fresh cooked snack before boarding but instead we are hopeful that the food on board may be better and therefore we will maintain our appetites. Shame on BA for not show casing the Best of British fare when passengers are leaving the UK.',\n",
       " \"As a Qantas Club member my wife two young children and I were refused entry as our children were counted as guests. A few days earlier we were allowed entry to the BA lounge in Vancouver and we have never had problems with Qantas lounges. BA's policy here is unfair to families travelling with kids. To make matters worse I raised the issue with the 'manager' and experienced appalling customer service bordering on vindictiveness.\",\n",
       " \"Not very well signposted to the location of the lounge I just happened to look left at the correct time! Excellent lounge though! Reception is staffed is by informative and jolly staff. As the lounge is only used by a handful of flights each day it is quiet and you can easily find yourself in a nice corner with a couple of tables and chairs to spread out. Full selection of wines spirits and beers were on offer with Peroni on draft which is a great addition to any airline lounge. Hot drinks machine was working. A good range of food was on offer with an assortment of finger sandwiches that weren't dry or tasteless. Nice little pasta pots also added a twist to the offerings. A good selection pastries. In terms of comfort the seating was good. The furnishings and little details gave it the signature British Airways lounge feel. Lack of departures screen can make you slightly anxious that you'll see your plane trundle past as you are fully reclined at one of the window seats. But the receptionist insists she will call the flight for you but being British we need to see it to believe it - by using the free Wi-Fi in the lounge keeping an eye on your flights status is possible. Overall a fantastic terraces lounge outside of the UK. Much larger than required but not going to complain! Food on offer left me content and drinks on offer were of expected quality.\",\n",
       " 'Visited this lounge on a late Monday afternoon. There were very few people in the lounge when we arrived so no problems finding a comfortable seat. The choice of food was very limited and the same as every time we use this lounge The only hot option was soup which although very good surely should not be the only choice in the middle of winter. Other options were salads cold pasta dish and sandwiches (which were beginning to curl at the edges!) The drinks available were as usual excellent with good wines good choice of spirits and non alcoholic beverages The staff were helpful and friendly. The only thing that lets this premium lounge down is the uninspired food choice.',\n",
       " \"There's almost nothing after customs except the BA Lounge. Great range of drinks and wines. Cheese and biscuits and a small range of sandwiches and wraps. No outside windows and quite small. Warm welcome. Comfortable seating.\",\n",
       " \"It's a trip up a few escalators at the end of the Terminal 5 departure lounge. Once you are finally there it is a quiet and spacious haven with various zones - you can use the internet relax on a sofa or at a table. There are various points for coffee and tea wines and spirits as well as a nice food area. For me it was morning and there was a selection of bacon rolls other hot breakfast items yoghurt sliced fresh fruits and juices. The washrooms were clean and shower facilites were also available. There is a similar lounge close to security but that is planned mainly for domestic/european passengers. The one at the far end of T5 is better.\",\n",
       " 'Visited the BA Lounge Galleries South lounge in T5A prior to a long haul flight to Asia. Very welcoming staff on the front desk. Good selection of newspapers and magazines available. Decent wi-fi which permitted streaming. The cinema area is a good place to relax. Basic but filling selection of hot food available including cous cous pasta and jacket potatoes with various fillings. Good selection of wines available. Attentive staff seemed to be working in the lounge and lounge was kept clean and tidy. Only minor criticism is that on my several recent visits to this lounge it has been very busy or seemingly near capacity with trouble getting a seat anywhere near the buffet area or the sofa area that overlooks the main concourse and the coffee is of vending machine standard. Otherwise this is a very good facility.',\n",
       " 'Easy to find. Pleasant welcome. Comfortable seating and good view of airport. Varied and tasteful food. Direct access from the lounge to the plane. Just what a lounge should be.',\n",

       " 'A spacious comfortable lounge but the selection of food available is no where near as good as that available in LHR T5. However much better than most US airport lounges.',\n",
       " 'Compared to other BA lounges in the UK and abroad this one really sucks. The location is good as the lounge is circular overlooking the main airside lounge and with runway views. The seating was tired and food was almost non existent. We had a midmorning transatlantic flight with American (booked through BA) and there was no evidence of the bacon rolls and other delights we are used to in Terminal 5. Toilets were in poor condition and the staff were lacklustre to say the least.',\n",
       " \"Used the Concorde Room in the run up to the Olympics and the height of the school holidays but it wasn't over crowded. I booked a cabana which has a day bed tv free telephone writing desk bathroom and the option to order room service. The staff regularly walked around taking orders from passengers and were delivered efficiently and with a smile. The lounge was also cleared of any glasses plates etc and was kept very tidy. The spa treatment was also very good but you need to book in advance to be sure of a treatment. The food choices were excellent for both lunch and dinner accompanied by a selection of vintage champagnes and fine wines.\",\n",
       " 'Great breakfast excellent service. However no massage slots available and sneered at for not booking in advance although never received any information or suggestion to do so. Was never required on previous flights to/from NY. Was spoken to as though I was a complete idiot for not booking before arriving and this was 3 hours before my flight.',\n",
       " 'Very small with no privacy. Close to gate so you can sit and watch plane being loaded. Poor selection of food and drink. Some strange sandwich fillings so ended up with a bag of crisps. WI-fi very slow. Toilets only had 2 cubicles to share with club lounge. Disappointing.',\n",
       " 'Bright airy great views. Quite busy for 6.15 on Sunday morning but I guess there were a lot of passengers having arrived fro the US Far East and Australia. Lots of seating and quite varied seating from armchairs to bar stools. Staff exceptionally friendly. Food OK but plentiful. Could do with a few more sockets for charging iPhones etc. Overall a very good experience.',\n",
       " \"Pleasant enough lounge. Separate area for those who want to watch TV. Not a great selection of drinks food adequate. Plenty of power points. You don't get blinded by the sun in this lounge as you do in other areas of the airport including the walk to the lounge from Security.\",\n",
       " 'The First Class lounge looks attractive and seemed classier than the Club lounge next door. The choice of drinks was reasonable with decent champagne but the quality of whiskey was rather low for a First class lounge. I used the showers in the Business Class lounge next door it was okay but I have certainly had better experiences. The real serious disappointment was the choice of food there were some cold sandwiches and packets of cheap cheese and a variety of crisps etc but nothing hot - a real let down.',\n",
       " 'There appear to be two lounges at Prague. The Crystal and another The Citigold which is supposed to be the better option. Considering the rest of the Airport which is spacious clean and serviceable the lounges were quite frankly awful. We had travelled BA Club Europe and were given passes to the Crystal Lounge. This offered a coffee machine and some nuts and limited seating. We then tried the Citigold as we have gold cards and this was not a lot better. They offered a fridge with some rather dry rolls and an assortment of cold salad pasta in individual pots. A plate of broken biscuits and solf drinks. The carpets looked pretty filthy and I was quite glad to get out of there Free wi-fi was available but we would probably have been better down at KFC in the main hall.',\n",

       " 'Design is good plenty of different areas and types of seating excellent selection of beverages and good selection of food although not outstanding. Staff clear tables very quickly after passengers leave and are very helpful. A very comfortable experience overall - could possibly be improved by an area for sleeping.',\n",
       " 'I spent about 8 hours in the lounge complex at Heathrow T5 and was impressed about the constant changes of food throughout the day. I used the north south and satellite lounges and they had variations on the menus. The north and satellite lounges do have manned cloakrooms to store belongings whereas the south lounge you leave items at your own risk. The lounges were kept clean and tidy despite the constant churn of passenger use. If you are looking for peace and quiet the satellite terminal is the quietest and if you require champagne it is upon request. Shower and bathroom facilities were also very good and kept clean. Wifi is free and plenty of computers to use. A most enjoyable way to start a trip.',\n",
       " 'In the North wing of T5. It is huge although on a Sunday morning plenty of the seat were occupied. Usual fare - nosh a bit ordinary. Seat so-so on comfort. All a bit so so really.',\n",
       " 'I was travelling on the daily BA flight to London we hit the lounge fairly early and there was nothing much to show in the way of snacks etc. In a conspiratorial voice we were told to tell the bar staff that we were flying with BA and so would not be charged for drinks and so forth (the prices for AA Passengers were ridiculous). We were also told that \"hot food\" would be available when the last AA flight departed. This proved to be soup and a tray of sandwiches some crudities and a dip. Seating was comfortable and staff were efficient and very helpful. Good views of the runway and ramps from the bar area. There were no showers and the bathrooms were not very modern and the fittings were in need of a makeover.',\n",
       " \"This is a rabbit warren to get around in. Reasonable to navigate around if you have a sense of direction and you can get your bearings. Good food and beverage range with attentive staff. Definitely no comparison to Qantas First Lounge at Sydney International but I imagine there aren't too many that would.\",\n",
       " 'When you present your First Class Boarding Passes to the First Reception Desk and are told \"you need to go over there\" (Club World Lounge) and you have to point out that you are a First Class passenger things do not bode well. The Lounge is okay but Champagne Bar doesn\\'t keep the champagne chilled adequately. First Class dining room has quite a limited menu and isn\\'t great. 6 months ago when I travelled First Class out of London we were invited to experience the dining room and presented an invitation to dine after a certain time. This practice has now gone - pity. In fact the hot self serve buffet had a better food choice than the dining area. Overall the First Class Lounge was okay but not great.',\n",
       " 'We arrived at the Lounge to be greeted by 4 friendly staff and encouraged to enter and relax. When we entered there were the best part of 150 people in it. We struggled to get the last two seats. We found out that they had closed the Business Class Lounge and put everyone into the First Class Lounge just to make us feel special I guess. Uncomfortable seating self serve basic buffet poor food and beverage to say the least. When we encountered a delay the staff were hopeless. Either inexperienced or incorrectly trained they could not cope or handle high yield passengers appropriately or properly. Choose another airport to transit with a better First Class Lounge.',\n",

       " 'British Airways share the Qantas lounge located near the gates which is nice. Welcome was friendly and staff attentive. Food selection is much better than in LHR and nice interesting choices. Lounge is quite spacious even though both BA flights and a Qantas flight were leaving at the same time. There are no views as the lounge is not near the windows of the airport. Showers are nice great water pressure and they use nice toiletries. Staff friendly and gave a small amenity kit. WiFi was strong and quick and the lounge was a serene place to relax.',\n",
       " 'A quiet and relaxed lounge with comfortable seating and superb views of the runways. There are facilities to leave bags and coats and private dining booths for breakfast and lunch. Food and drink is waiter service. Although afternoon tea does not feature on any menu the staff were more than happy to serve this for me. I used one of the cabanas where you have a day bed desk TV phone for free use and luxury bathroom facilities. You can order room service from your cabana. The Elemis Spa is located just outside the lounge but book a treatment early to avoid disappointment. For me using this lounge is part of my holiday before a long haul flight.',\n",
       " \"This was an exceptionally nice lounge albeit small for 2 flights departing close together. For the next year plus it is also to serve as the Admiral's Club for AA Needless to say it has gone from a little haven of peace to a typical US lounge facility. British Airways passengers and the staff clearly hate the situation.\",\n",

A good selection of drinks available the attended counter being closed. Food was pretty poor with only a few stale looking croissant sandwiches and soup on offer. The flight announcements were barely audible where we were seated and I had to go and check with the reception that it had indeed been our flight which had been called. Wi-fi and computer availability were good. Unfortunately the arrivals and departure screens only dealt with AA flights.',\n",
       " 'Spacious lounge with comfortable and quiet seating areas. The selection of food and beverage is excellent though service when ordering from the menu is slow. Many computer terminals and helpful staff at the inner Customer Service desk. The decorative glass screens between seating areas are lovely when lit if dark outside. The lounge location benefits from nice views of the tarmac and taxiways. The showers and Elemis Health Spa are located outside the lounge and shared with the Galleries Business Class Lounge that is located above.',\n",
       " \"Without a doubt the most miserable business lounge on this planet. Having travelled from London and using the fantastic BA lounge I had the misfortune to land in LA and through a reciprocal arrangement with BA I used the American Airlines Admirals Club lounge. It's a joke - you pay for almost everything the only free stuff consists of things like lukewarm and stewed instant coffee stale biscuits and a few bruised pieces of fruit. You get one drink voucher and no wifi access unless you are a member. Suggest you give this place and American Airlines a wide berth! Unfortunately my next leg is with American Airlines and no surprises you have to pay for in flight coffee and food! I will never fly with budget airline American Airlines again!\",\n",
       " 'I was frankly very disappointed. Only half of the food on the bar menu was available and someone did tell me about other food options that were apparently available but they mumbled so much I have no clue as to what they said - at the third time of asking I gave up.',\n",
       " \"At the bag drop in Terminal 5 the British Airways staff member let me know that the Galleries North lounge would be much closer to my flight's departure gate than the South lounge. I had not used the North lounge before and went along there assuming it would be the same as the South lounge. In fact it was much less enjoyable. The North lounge is significantly smaller and was extremely crowded with almost all the seats taken. It was noisy hot and felt congested with passenger's carry-on bags filling the walkspace. The food selection was similar to the South lounge but the range of magazines available was very limited. Next time I will know to go straight to the South lounge whichever gate my flight leaves from and just leave the extra time to walk up to the gates at the north of the terminal.\",\n",

Overall a good experience it is a nice place to wait for a flight.',\n",
       " 'This is a newly refurbished lounge modelled on the Concorde Room at LHR. Very comfortable and plenty of space as this lounge is for exclusive use of BA passengers only travelling in First. The food and beverages were of high quality and a dining area if you wished to use it. The wifi was a bit slow so gave up in the end. The spa facilities are upstairs in the Terraces lounge and so are shower facilities.',\n",
       " 'A great lounge with plenty of high quality and comfortable seating. The dining options are extensive and there is also an extensive range of drinks to choose from. The private cabanas are good to use as you have more seclusion from the rest of the lounge and have your own bathroom day bed TV writing desk and you can order room service too. There is also a telephone in the room where you can phone for free anywhere in the world. The Boardroom has free computers and a printer and the seats are original Concorde chairs. There are secure storage facilities for your belongings and clean bathroom facilities.',\n",
       " 'The only hot food available were plastic containers of Two-Minute Noodles. Alcohol is served from a bar which is not always tended - you have to ring a bell and wait. The only other food is packets of crisps crackers cheese. The windows are blocked off by translucent blinds making it rather claustrophobic.',\n",
       " 'The Concorde Room really has lost its exclusive feel. It was very crowded and from the destinations people were travelling too full of passengers not travelling in First - it is supposed to be only for First passengers according to the BA hype. The staff spent much time discussing their work issues loudly in full hearing of the passengers. Staff do not actively patrol to see if anyone needs anything which is odd since nothing on offer is available self-service. Food service was O.K. but not very professional and the presentation on the plate would be fine for a transport caff. The whole deal falls short of what one expects of true first class service but of course that is typical of the whole experience on BA.',\n",

The selection of sandwiches was poor two choices plus a wrap of some sort. The pre flight dinner which BA offers for overnight flights to London was cold or lukewarm. Hardly surprising when the chef spent most of his time on the internet in the business section of the lounge instead of in the kitchen! The exception was the excellent sweetcorn chowder of which I had two bowls as the rest of the food was stale and uninviting. Not a patch on the preflight dinner I enjoyed a couple of years ago at JFK. I don't know if this is yet another sign of the diminishing standards with BA or just a lazy chef. No showers either.

Lounge a bit old and worn now but don’t expect BA will upgrade (they only seem to be in the business of downgrading everything these days). Good selection of drinks. Sandwiches at lunchtimes nice freshly prepared and a good selection. A nice place to wait for an hour or a bit longer. The staff are the same two or three very pleasant ladies – wish BA would commission them to train their FA colleagues in customer centricity! One negative - just one loo and it has never flushed properly since my two years using it.',\n",

The lounge is rather soulless and lacking in comfort and style. There are just medium-sized seats spread out over the lounge. The food was basic and mediocre consisting mainly of cheese and ham bread rolls and what appeared to be a quinoa salad. The standard fizzy drinks on offer. Curiously red and whte wine was available but in a beer-like pouring mechanism. In short there is no need to get to the airport early to enjoy this lounge because there is not much to enjoy unlike other BA lounges.',\n",

You can sit outside and relax and watch the kids inside. Very good idea! Great selection of French and european wine great nibbles. Only downside - Coffee machine made terrible coffee and the restaurant did not open for the entire 7 hours we were there (not enough clients??). Still had the snack menu but no sit down fine dining as advertised. At 6.30pm it had still not opened for dinner and after asking and getting no response we left to catch our flight. I am still confused as to what was going on here. Free PCs with internet too.',\n",

I have rarely been in a lounge of this size where I have not not been able to find any seating whatsoever. The lounge was absolutely packed! It was so full that I decided to leave after a while because it was not worth the effort to find some personal space in the lounge. I wanted to go on-line but apart from two free computers wireless was at a charge. I paid quite a hefty charge and I had major problems trying to connect. I could only spend five minutes on-line and I was constantly disconnected. In summary there is significant room for improvement!',\n",
       " 'I visited one lounge in the main part of T5 only to see a \"Boarding Now\" sign for my flight which was not departing for nearly 2 hours. It turns out they were trying to get people to the T5B satellite because of enhanced security procedures. I made my way over to T5B and used the lounge there - not crowded and plenty of food good wifi access free computers to use. All in all a pleasant quiet place to spend time before flight. One negative for BA: when I arrived at Heathrow a week previously - the Arrivals lounge at T5 had already closed promptly at 2pm. This seems very early given that the 2nd schedule SFO-LHR flight arrives at 2 pm.',\n",
       " \"One would have thought that British Airways/Jersey would have taken notice of R Pemberton's review of this lounge - 12 August 2009. Absolutely nothing has changed - for the better that is. At the time of my visit (late afternoon) dirty crockery was strewn across the tables. The elderly male attendant did not even bother to look up when I entered so no check of my credentials and certainly not greeting. It may be that BA Jersey are trying to save on electricity but I could not find any other reason for all the ceiling lights being switched off. There are table lamps but it was difficult to read the dog-eared newspapers on the shelves. Carpets and upholstery are still filthy so no change there. I used the newly built lavatory which appeared not to have been cleaned that day. I live in Jersey and this is my local airport. What sort of impression does this hellhole make on departing passengers?\",\n",
       " \"The recent experience of the BA Terraces lounge at Gatwick was one of total shock - since my last visit in October. 50% of the facility has been closed - what was on two floors providing a very good experience - is now an insult to every BA Club World customer - as it is now located on 1 floor. Passengers cannot find seats (due to overcrowding) - and me and my family of 4 had to half stand and half sit as we ate our snack breakfast. BA's cost cutting has reached a new and deeply insulting low in the way it treats it's premium customers - thankful I am flying with another airline this month to New Zealand.\",\n",
       " \"This is a very cold and dull lounge. The staff are far from welcoming - it's as if you have ruined their day just by being there. As someone else mentioned there is evidence of cost cutting throughout - fine for those in economy but not what one expects after paying so much more for a business class experience. The refreshments on offer were pathetic. I was there for an early morning flight and there were baskets of mini croissants and pan au chocolat cereal toast and coffee/juices etc. 100% self-service. Miserable staff hanging around like vultures ready to clear your table before you have finished swallowing your last mouthful. You can go out to the duty free shops but they don't bother to offer to look after your bags and coats so you need to lug them around with you if you are carrying anything of value which I usually am (laptop etc).\",\n",
       " 'Arrived at Suvarnabhumi Airport a little early in order to check out BA/QF first class lounge. Very disappointed. Nothing special - if anything the Business Class lounge opposite was as good if not better. The First lounge was small very limited food - cheese platter 2 choices two types of rolls and wraps. Only difference between business and First was choice of wines and champagne.',\n",
       " 'The lounge in Miami needs a total refurbishment its old fashioned with a poor selection of food. A real let down.',\n",
       " 'Not worth the extra cost in my opinion. The lounge was busy - it was difficult to get a seat. The breakfast was paltry - tiny croissants for instance. There was no sense of luxury - an air of convenience and cost-effectiveness. Staff were not particularly polite.',\n",
       " 'Though this lounge is very new it really is not big enough to handle the 2 flights which leave quite close together in the evening. The staff however are exemplary - very welcoming professional and friendly with a real sense of enjoying their interaction with the passengers. There is a good selection of food and drinks with very acceptable pre-flight dining. If only the T5 lounges were the same as this one.',\n",
       " 'Shocked is all I can say. After trying the Concorde Lounge earlier in the year the Terraces was a huge let down. We got to the airport 4 hours before the flight yet told the spa was full. The food was mediocre we had to ask for champagne. It was comfortable enough and the wifi was good.',\n",
       " \"As a Gold card member I could use this lounge (unlike Heathrow's Concorde lounge which is exclusive for 1st passengers) as I awaited my flight to Antigua. Carpet very worn and dull as was most of the chairs and seating; everything felt like a 60s time warp. Food/breakfast was OK - nothing to speak about. Coffee machine appeared to be the only thing different to the club terraces option. Disappointing.\",\n",
       " \"It's the attentive staff that makes this lounge a real pleasure. Staff members have always gone the extra mile to deal with seating upgrade and flight change and other special requests. Efficiency and smiles are a great combination. Food and drink are average but adequate. Too bad the washrooms are outside the lounge.\",\n",
       " \"This lounge is shared by BA and Qantas and doesn't have many seats. So unless you get there quite early you might find it difficult to find a seat. The seats are old and need a make over. The choice of drinks is limited. Only one red one white and one sparkling wine (not champagne). The choice of food was limited to nuts fruit cold finger sandwiches cheese and crackers and Asian snacks (very tasty). Okay selections of newspapers no TV screens and a limited number of IT stations with one out of order. The lavatories were clean and so were the shower rooms.\",\n",
       " 'There is a daily flight to/from Gatwick from Antigua and it is a disGrace that BA use this shoddy \"shared\" lounge - landside at Antigua VC Bird Airport. Its like a tomb - windows are shuttered and those not - look into a large waiting area that never seems to be used. An array of snacks are left on the sideboard - a bit of cheese and raw vegetables - drinks are served by a waiter. Dire - if you travel to Antigua and miss it don\\'t worry about it.',\n",
       " 'The BA lounge in MXP is an old style terrace lounge. The lounge is very clean and the staff friendly and welcoming. The food served is quite good all Italian style focaccia sandwiches small pizzas etc. The choice of drinks is good with lots of typical Italian drinks available. Good selection of newspapers and a few IT stations although only one was working properly. There was also a smoking room available. Dirty plates and glasses were cleared continuously.',\n",
       " \"This is a shared lounge used by several airlines - pleasantly surprised with plenty of seating available. Lounge looks modern with lots of natural daylight spacious clean. On one side is quite a large bar. No self service for coffee tea etc you go to the bar and have your drink prepared for you - I think this gives a more personal service. On the bar is a menu listing available sandwiches. Around the lounge were monitors displaying flight information and announcements were made frequently about boarding or gate changes which is in contrast to Heathrow T5 where there are no announcements. I prefer announcements as you don't need to keep getting up. Near reception is a smoking room with a television displaying the news. The smoking room was as comfortable as the main lounge and was just as clean with staff clearing cups and plates regularly across the entire lounge. A magazine rack was located near the entrance with daily newspapers and magazines in Russian Ukrainian and English but staff weren't clearing left newspapers often. When my flight was called the gate was literally 30 feet away. This lounge certainly was a relaxing retreat away from the crowds and I wish more were like this.\",\n",
       " \"This is easily the poorest of all the BA 1st class lounges I have frequented. It is a reasonably large space which fills up very rapidly within a few hours of the 2 to 3 late night flights back to London. Very often you will struggle to find a comfortable seat. I no longer eat anything in this lounge as the quality of the catering is not up to scratch. You will hardly ever find a UK newspaper (unless you are 3-4 hours early) and I can't think of a single redeeming feature of this lounge - not even a good view. It is well overdue a complete refurbishment and the general decor is grubby and tatty. Singapore - London is a very busy route for BA and presumably therefore somewhat profitable. If you travel the same route with Singapore Airlines the lounges are far superior as is the general lounge service.\",\n",
       " \"I found the lounge very comfortable. Enough space for everyone although it was a Friday before a bank holiday weekend. The choice of hot food is limited but appropriate. Used plates and glasses are promptly removed by the staff who are polite and assist requests promptly. I didn't use the showers but the Elemis receptionist went out of her way and gave me her unused personal Elemis lip saver although these products were not generally available to passengers. BA should improve the magazines selection.\",\n",
       " 'The new club lounge at T3 is very nice large and spacious with different seating areas. There was a large selection of both hot and cold food. The red and white wines are in different seating areas which is slightly strange and champagne is only available if you ask. The staff were attentive and customer service could not be faulted.',\n",
       " 'This is the new improved lounge and is for those entitled to \"First Class\" privileges but not travelling First Class I was travelling domestically so this was why I used this lounge. Seriously this is the best BA can come up with after how many years. I asked for the restaurant and was shown the buffet. The lounge was nice even allowing for the fact that it was hot in some areas and cool in others. Showers were basic. Staff friendly and helpful. Not worth the effort to try it out.',\n",
       " \"Great improvement on the old lounge. Quite small but well appointed. The First restaurant excellent - although we were the only two customers - with service both efficient and attentive. Bit of a walk to get there from the underpass walkway however although if you're not in a desperate hurry it's no real problem. As usual this comes at the end of a mass of confusion and waiting for security even in the Premium queue.\",\n",
       " 'Had a longish layover due to BA delay and resulting re-booking so decided to use one of the cabanas. These are hotel-style rooms with day bed TV and music and a private bath. Had champagne and lunch delivered to the room so very nice. Then I discovered that the room only had one temperature - freezing cold Also the rooms back up to what may be a kitchen with constant banging of doors and other loud noises. Not very much chance of getting a rest here. Finally moved out into the lounge proper which is already showing some signs of wear and struggles to accomodate everyone at busy times. Restaurant food choices are rather uninspired and presentation not of the highest standard. Service can be inconsistent. For an exclusively First Class lounge this could be better.',\n",
       " 'I recently read a review on this website regarding the Terrace lounge facilities at Jersey airport and was shocked to find it had deteriorated even further from the original submission. Food and dirty plates had been left out for many hours stained carpets and a poorly stocked bar compounded by a member of staff deciding to leave the lounge at 8 pm half an hour before the last flight was due to depart. Passengers had no idea it had incurred a delay and our only source of information came from data streams located on TV’s 100m away from the lounge. Simply terrible British Airways I would recommend that anyone flying Business class from Jersey attempts to spend as much time away from the lounge as you will only be disappointed with the service.',\n",
       " 'Club Europe Lounge at Gatwick is very nice. It is on two floors and very spacious. The food selection is simple (only sandwiches pasta salads and similar and cheese with biscuits) plus the usual snacks. The only hot food served is soup. Very good selection of drinks with champagne on request very good selection of newspapers and magazines. IT workstations worked very well and are very modern. The toilet facilities are good with excellent showers and you can ask for Elemis products. The only downside was the lack of atmosphere. The lounge is very quite and with no music played in the background it could have been very boring.',\n",
       " 'Small but fine for the number of travellers on the day. Good atmosphere. Standard of food and drink good but range limited in comparison to say Galleries. so scores down a little.',\n",
       " \"Only food available was cheese and crackers. A waitress eventually appeared but did not approach anyone - she had to be asked for drinks. She brought them through and was never seen again. The room is fully enclosed and looks out on the seating area in the departure lounge - before security. The decor is drab a few magazines to read as well as some out of date newspapers. Couldn't wait to get on the plane. Shame as it soured the end of our holiday slightly.\",\n",
       " 'Pretty busy lounge with good wifi and announcement when new UK newspapers arrived. Alcoholic drinks only available through a servery with occasional missing staff and therefore short queues and delays. Pleasant and efficient staff.']"

       " 'tatty and uncared for the ba business lounge in gatwick south terminal seems to be unloved and uncared for the staff try hard but there is little loyalty they do not work for ba information on flights is scarce due to them not working direct and on one occasion they were told by ba to “stop bothering them” when they were trying to ascertain the status of a much delayed flight despite the flight having been delayed for over five hours the customers were kicked out of the lounge two hours before boarding as it was closing i would certainly never fly with this truly rotten and totally incompetent airline again',\n",
       " 'crowded or rather overcrowded as usual the catering staff in the lounge are nice polite and helpful  in contrast to the reception ba staff who are rude abrasive and have no right to be facing customers the toilets are terrible long queues to access one no urinals so all men have to queue up for the single toilets as with so many other parts of the famous ba costcutting all magazines and newspapers have not been returned after covid and this is now a further drop in standards food is okay but hot food is real canteen style and not a match on many airlines first class standards to call this a first lounge is a disgrace and you are probably better off going to one of the restaurants in the main departure hall and one thing you will note heathrow public toilets are nicer and kept cleaner than the ba lounge facilities',\n",

       " 'we were at the british airways terminal 5 south business lounge at heathrow airport on the evening of april 24 2023 we were shocked to see not one but three mice running under and around our chairs and table the wait staff told me the lounge is infested with mice and that british airways and heathrow airport have known about this for months i was so disgusted that i left i was then told by a flight attendant that their crew lounge is also infested with mice lastly i was told by an airport meet and greet that the problem is not just limited to the british air lounges in addition to the active mice the lounge was very dark the tables were dirty as was the glassware totally disgusting and unacceptable the health department needs to close the lounge in my opinion',\n",

       " 'this galleries lounge is very similar to the ones in t5 although it is much smaller they have the same choice of food and drinks and similar facilities it is extremely quite due to the small number of ba flights out of t3 and the downside is the lack of natural light the windows are quite narrow and the lack of atmosphere even the ba staff looked bored and not very welcoming',\n",
