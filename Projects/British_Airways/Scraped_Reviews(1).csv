E Carmere,there is not enough space,the lounge is clean but the seats are worn and there is not enough space to accommodate all the passengers travelling in club and those with silver and having access to the lounge nothing wrong decent sandwiches but no hot food only soup decent choice of alcoholic beverages and acceptable wines service with a smile vonly a shame the restrooms are extremely basic and not very clean,14th March 2024,Barbados Grantley Adams Airport,6
Tony Maddern,staff were welcoming and friendly,the lounge is very spacious with a wide variety of areas to sit and a kids play area food was amazing with hot cooked foods at breakfast alcoholic beverages were limited to wine  sparking wine as it was morning very clean and showers are available which was great after connecting from an overnight flight from new york staff were welcoming and friendly,21st December 2023,London Heathrow Airport,10
S Neale,rotten and totally incompetent airline,tatty and uncared for the ba business lounge in gatwick south terminal seems to be unloved and uncared for the staff try hard but there is little loyalty they do not work for ba information on flights is scarce due to them not working direct and on one occasion they were told by ba to “stop bothering them” when they were trying to ascertain the status of a much delayed flight despite the flight having been delayed for over five hours the customers were kicked out of the lounge two hours before boarding as it was closing i would certainly never fly with this truly rotten and totally incompetent airline again,28th September 2023,London Gatwick Airport,1
Peter Glasier,"ba staff who are rude, abrasive",crowded or rather overcrowded as usual the catering staff in the lounge are nice polite and helpful  in contrast to the reception ba staff who are rude abrasive and have no right to be facing customers the toilets are terrible long queues to access one no urinals so all men have to queue up for the single toilets as with so many other parts of the famous ba costcutting all magazines and newspapers have not been returned after covid and this is now a further drop in standards food is okay but hot food is real canteen style and not a match on many airlines first class standards to call this a first lounge is a disgrace and you are probably better off going to one of the restaurants in the main departure hall and one thing you will note heathrow public toilets are nicer and kept cleaner than the ba lounge facilities,1st September 2023,London Heathrow Airport,2
Richard Hodges,full service has been resumed,flew london to kalamata and as a silversaphire member used the galleries south lounge covid had meant that food offerings had been stripped back to a bare minimum but i am pleased that a full service has been resumed quite busy but found two comfortable seats easily enough had a decent full english breakfast with a glass of champagne and very good cup or two of coffee much better ba,20th June 2023,London Heathrow Airport,9
Ellen Blaine Adams,the lounge is infested with mice,we were at the british airways terminal 5 south business lounge at heathrow airport on the evening of april 24 2023 we were shocked to see not one but three mice running under and around our chairs and table the wait staff told me the lounge is infested with mice and that british airways and heathrow airport have known about this for months i was so disgusted that i left i was then told by a flight attendant that their crew lounge is also infested with mice lastly i was told by an airport meet and greet that the problem is not just limited to the british air lounges in addition to the active mice the lounge was very dark the tables were dirty as was the glassware totally disgusting and unacceptable the health department needs to close the lounge in my opinion,4th May 2023,London Heathrow Airport,1
G Marsen,cold and unwelcoming,a pretty underwhelming experience the staff on the desk to greet us were quite cold and unwelcoming the same was true of the staff on the baggage storage desk and the shower suite desk the shower facilities were in desperate need of refurbishment as is the lounge in general the food on offer was quite nice and the atmosphere was quiet and relaxed which is what we needed after a very long flight bottom line though is ba really need to improve the quality of their staff and give this particular lounge a refresh,28th April 2023,London Heathrow Airport,5
P Horten,not a bad experience,i travelled on a weekend which i never normally do so was taken aback by how busy the lounge was i did find a decent seat luckily and tried from both the breakfast and lunch menu both offered a decent selection of nice food and beverages on the wine side a really ordinary prosecco was available to self serve but you needed to order champagne i did find a really good sauvignon which exceeded my expectations and only wish that happened more the staff were very good at keeping a really busy lounge not looking too distressed with the volume of customers generally not a bad experience but hardly outstanding i guess you need to head to the gulf states for that,12th April 2023,London Heathrow Airport,6
Ian Sinclair,shoddy level of service,arrived from johannesburg and went to the concorde room for breakfast thirty minutes after ordering nothing arrived apparently order lost between the dining area and the kitchen lounge not busy so no excuse for this shoddy level of service it was a chaotic shambles and given that this is bas flagship lounge it was extremely disappointing i eventually went to the first lounge and had breakfast there the staff in the concorde lounge really need a refresher course there is no excuse for getting something so straightforward wrong,11th March 2023,London Heathrow Airport,2
M Kidd,as basic as it gets,ba business class ticket holders access escape lounge which is also a pay per use lounge compared with ba’s lounges around the world this is as basic as it gets self service hot and cold snacks soft drinks and teacoffee alcohol on request from the bar the wines are cheap and don’t compare to business class offerings at ba lounge is tidy there’s a waste trolley on view where staff scrape dirty plates into the bin and stack dirty plates very off putting staff like to chat amongst themselves the ‘meet and greet’ person on the lounge was glued to her chair and social media shouting ‘hiya’ and ‘see ya’ every now and again the lounge is a nice escape from the crowds downstairs with lots of charging points for devices,25th January 2023,Manchester Airport,1
C Keane,drink choices have been limited,only a few usb ports are working food offerings were better than before drink choices have been limited to minimalist no more zacapa rum or woodford reserve not even jack daniels if u don’t like bulleit bourbon that includes onboard packed lounge with sun boiling anyone sitting in its way as there’s no window shading staff were working hard i felt given the amount of people bottled water removed shame as it was handy only tiny 250ml beer cans available no tiger or amstel choices…,17th January 2023,London Heathrow Airport,4
Jeremy Archdale,lack of breakfast on offer,having paid ba over £7000 for our trip to barbados we rather thought we might be able to get some breakfast before boarding we tried a very overcrowded lounge soon after security and managed a small plate of baked beans toast and bacon were not on offer a member of the lounge staff tipped us off that the business lounge in c satellite would be more comfortable so we went there much less crowded but the same lack of breakfast on offer,13th December 2022,London Heathrow Airport,1
C King,the food was surprisingly good,the food was surprisingly good back to self service breakfast and lunch plenty of drinks selection but sadly no more gentleman jack or woodford reserve also no zacapa rum which is  disappointing bulleit bourbon is simply awful for a saturday afternoon there was plenty of seats staff all very polite and friendly,10th December 2022,London Heathrow Airport,7
S Keale,experience could not have been better!,others have reviewed this quite harshly our experience could not have been better in fact this is one of the best lounges we have visited and we have been to many other business lounges its nearly up there with istanbul and singapore very well laid out with plenty of space and places to siteat the choice and variety of food was excellent we arrived just at the breakfast lunch changeover so we had a pretty great choice this lounge is in total contrast to the swiss business lounge at zurich which we visited the day before that was just pathetic  a very good lounge,19th November 2022,London Heathrow Airport,10
C Mayle,way too crowded,way too crowded with many people walking around looking for a place to sit no champagne at the champagne bar although a staff member did bring a tray of filled glasses after mentioning that passengers were walking off with the bottles ba used to have a display in the terminal showing how crowded each of the t5 lounges were but that wasnt visible this time staff were trying valiantly but the number of people was simply too much for them to do more than the bare minimum of clearing glasses and dishes next time i think ill just have a glass of champagne and some nice oysters outside  even if i have to pay it will definitely be more comfortable and less stressful,24th October 2022,London Heathrow Airport,3
Jonathan Fisher,"overcrowded, inedible food",awful experience overcrowded inedible food disgusting toilets we left almost immediately and went to sit in the terminal ba should be ashamed of this facility,16th October 2022,London Heathrow Airport,2
J Meesen,british airways lounge is excellent,the british airways lounge is excellent i had a nice cream tea though i avoided the tea and had strawberry baileys instead the scone was excellent the clotted cream great and the strawberry jam nice after that i went through to the rest area where hightech seats are available but i have a 20 minute limit however since there were very few people waiting i just used another and another 20 minutes with no problem disadvantages of the ba lounge were that there were very few charging points available beside the seats in the rest area there was a charging point but elsewhere they were few and far between the drink selection was good apart from a rather unusual absence of cognac armagnac or brandy however the strawberry baileys and birthday cake baileys along with a wide selection of other choices made up for the missing brandy the food was excellent,25th June 2022,London Heathrow Airport,9
Chris Walsh,5b lounge is so much better than the t5a lounge,terminal 5b lounge is so much better than the t5a lounge nice and quiet it is worth the train and walk back to the main terminal the lounge at t5a is huge and quite impersonal,8th June 2022,London Heathrow Airport,10
Guy Senior,very badly laid out lounge,not british airways best very badly laid out lounge limited facilities and no views however staff very nice the terminal is being rebuilt so hopefully this will improve,21st April 2022,Chicago O'Hare Airport,6
Richard Hodges,food offering has further declined,used on wednesday 16 march before our flight to barbados busy but could still find a comfortable seat and a reasonable selection of drinks on offer coffee machines working this time most were not november 2021 and very good coffee it was unfortunately and as i suspected in november 2021 the food offering has further declined: the hot offering was just a bacon roll only this time without even hash browns a couple of nice pastries on offer it is clear that ba are now using covid as the excuse to downgrade their offerings and cost cut what used to be a very nice lounge with a decent buffet breakfast selection has now gone for good i fear,5th April 2022,London Heathrow Airport,5
Chris Walsh,"light, airy and decent food",well organised lounge light airy and decent food food was pretty good and coffee was excellent as youd expect in italy not so sure itd be the best for a long stop but great for short,5th April 2022,Venice Marco Polo Airport,7
Chris Walsh,rude staff and disgusting toilets,possibly the worst lounge with the most miserable staff many people havent flown for a long time and lounges methods have changed poor food rude staff and disgusting toilets,5th April 2022,London Heathrow Airport,1
Jeff Michel,very crowded and thus uncomfortable,nice views of the runway in one section but very crowded and thus uncomfortable good selection of drinks but their app system of ordering food no buffet means that when it gets delivered to your table means it is cold weird setup in there and certainly not conducive to a relaxed wait for your flight i am sure that ba can do better stressed passengers do not deal with the inevitable delayed flight as well as relaxed ones,4th April 2022,London Heathrow Airport,3
Guy Senior,fantastically helpful staff,the lounge has been refurbished since my last visit but difficult to see any major changes however very pleasant and fantastically helpful staff  full marks to them,9th February 2022,Geneva Airport,9
Richard Hodges,food offering has declined dramatically,used this lounge on 5th november before our flight to tenerife still a reasonably comfortable place to wait for your flight with a good selection of drinks however since covid19 the standard of the food offering has declined dramatically with just a bacon roll and hash browns as the main hot offering food also has to be ordered by a lounge app and you will be served at your table at least 2 of the coffee machines were not working and causing problems no longer a real premium offering  one can only hope that when covid eventually dies down the lounge can return to its former decent buffet but im not holding my breath  ba may just use this as an excuse to become the new normal lounge service,15th November 2021,London Heathrow Airport,6
R Marston,lack of that truly luxurious feel,this was the first time using this terminal 5 lounge after recently becoming a british airways executive club gold member i was travelling on an economy hand baggage only flight with a non status friend and he was allowed to enter as my guest there isnt a huge difference between the business and the first class lounge you still have the british airways nhs style showers and toilets furnishings that arent too modern and the lack of that truly luxurious feel but there is an upgrade in the drinks variety more premium brands of drinks this visit was during covid and so you had to order food and snacks by scanning a qr code entering your table number and placing your order ba lounges have never been truly luxurious if you have one world status you are better off visiting the likes of cathay pacific whose bathrooms are beautifully designed tiled and contain aesop products but if you want an english breakfast for instance ba is your best bet,22nd August 2021,London Heathrow Airport,7
G Warlan,lounge has no windows,i visited this lounge in march when travel reduced because of the virus this lounge is used by aer lingus and other oneworld elites which make this lounge crowded especially in the evening the snack options in the lounge are decent and something you can work with this lounge has no windows and very low ceilings which make it gloomy club dining is a nice option and highly recommended its less crowded than the rest of the lounge because of restricted access and a good choice of hot food in response to bas sleeper service,25th April 2020,Chicago O'Hare Airport,6
Mark Ellwood,lounge was very basic,this american airlines admirals club lounge was very basic with limited food and drink options plenty of different seating areas but it was a real let down and not worth using in my opinion i expected more but would advise just sitting in main terminal and paying for some food i am surprised this is an american airlines lounge but they must be easily pleased would not bother using or even go to the bother of finding the lounge if you just want a drink and a cracker then you will love it total waste of time,12th January 2020,Rio De Janeiro Airport,1
Mark Ellwood,food was very hit and miss,i used the terminal 5 north lounge as i find this lounge less busy plenty of seats today so no problems for me food was very hit and miss some strange bread rolls with bacon they were heavily seeded and strange not to my liking what is wrong with plain  plenty of hot cold and soft drinks as well as the usual alcohol  todays use of lounge was fine a bit busier as the morning went on toilets needed cleaning,3rd January 2020,London Heathrow Airport,7
Neil Jeram,quality felt lacking,the lounge is divided into business and first and has been renovated late evening the club world lounge was quiet plentiful seating decent selection of drinks i found the f & b is nowhere near the standards of aa with their flagship lounge or other one world ones i most often use maybe it was later in the evening but quality felt lacking the ambience was very flat terminal 7 at jfk is the ba terminal and whilst great for ba and its one world partners to have its own space its a very tired terminal washrooms are still the same cramped space and the showers clearly have not been renovated,17th December 2019,New York JFK Airport,4
Mike Andrésen,excellent service all over,the galleries first lounge at heathrow was beautiful and calm place to relax or work a bit between your flights excellent service all over nothing much more you can ask for even with a first class ticket price,7th December 2019,London Heathrow Airport,9
Mike Andrésen,superb service and good space,the concorde lounge is a place to relax and a place to eat superb service and good space you can sit inside the lounge or the area outside above the departure hall if you like some more buzz nice dining area and good food only downside is there are a little short of bathrooms,7th December 2019,London Heathrow Airport,10
David Ellis,a definite improvement,the club world and first galleries lounge at johannesburg has been the subject of much needed refurbishment and reflects a new harmonised policy for housing both classes under one roof without as overt a distinction as before to be honest the previous first lounge was something of an embarrassment with too few seats and general feeling of being cramped the new arrangement eschews a separate first lounge but allocates a separate first dining area this seems to work reasonably well the rest of the lounge is by no means spacious but there are adequate seats to accommodation the club and first passengers on the two evening flights to lhr the food seems to substantially better than before with regular refreshes of both hot and cold food the bar area is spacious as bar areas go and service was good overall the new galleries lounge is a definite improvement for club passengers; first passengers may not agree of course,7th December 2019,Johannesburg Airport,7
P Huang,"overall, a great visit",after a subpar visit to the qantas lounge next door my partner and i decided to give the british airways lounge a go it was a completely different experience a much better one in my opinion the space had such character with striking decors along with a great layout for dining work and relaxation the catering was fantastic with plenty of options for food and beverages with plenty of comfortable seating to enjoy it customer service was average lounge team were present and making sure food was plentiful plus consistently tidying but lack face to face service shower facilities were adequate but lacked in numbers overall a great visit as i would definitely pick this lounge over the qantas and third party offerings,20th October 2019,Singapore Changi Airport,8
Mark Ellwood,food options were very good,main galleries lounge in terminal 5 at heathrow was very busy food options were very good and plentiful the main lounge agates as usual were very busy not helped when some of the u shaped seating areas have massive square tables making it difficult for people to get seated very bad design we had a cgate departure so left the lounge and went to the quieter lounge in the bgate area which i would always recommend people to do,19th October 2019,London Heathrow Airport,6
R Gonzaga,most sections were shut,cathay pacific uses this lounge for their washington flights to hkg the lounge is nice but most sections were shut as it is 11pm at night there was no hot food apart from soup and there are  sandwiches on offer and lots of fresh fruit the usual tea and coffee and white and red wine plus a few beers  if you plan to dine before you fly so you can catch maximum sleep on the plane dont plan on doing it in this lounge which is miserable the toilets were not clean with paper towels everywhere the staff were pleasant enough cx needs to do something about their lounge access in iad,16th September 2019,Washington Dulles Airport,3
Sam Healey,nicely appointed with good food,the ba lounge at newark airport is very nicely appointed with good food the steak and ale pie on offer that evening was delicious and plenty of seating throughout the female toilets were also spotlessly clean and tidy i was very happy to see rosa there again this staff member and all the team work very hard to keep customers happy,19th August 2019,Newark Airport,9
C Marvere,there is plenty of food,i used the business lounge south on heathrow t5 and as usual it was rather busy plenty of newspapers  magazines and books available to read and decent internet there is plenty of food pastries and chocolates fruits and yoghurts also bread filled with bacon however no cheese or ham available  jams and marmalade out of big tins ample choice of teas and coffee also  despite it was rather early  lots of wines and alcoholic beverages even better brands like grey goose and sodas there is a lot to eat and to drink only a shame the food is not refined,18th July 2019,London Heathrow Airport,7
Mark Ellwood,not what you expect from a club lounge,really looking forward to the new airport opening the old lounge is very odd at least you no longer have to ring the bell to get in but you do have to knock on the door it is rather small and the offerings are miserable just a few sandwiches on a plate total 12 cut quarters at a time a selection of cheese crisps and some fruit a strange man always the same one who wanders around and refills you have a selection of drinks and a few tv screens not what you expect from a club lounge but it has always been the same toilets ok again limited roll on 2020,2nd July 2019,Bermuda Airport,4
Mark Ellwood,for once a very pleasant stay,plenty of space and lots of seats to choose at the gatwick club world lounge the food selections it was lunchtime 12:30 were very good not the usual finger treats and a few sandwiches but a good selection of chilli meatballs chicken stew with beans baked potatoes rice cooked very well and the sandwiches and nibbles i was absolutely full and thoroughly enjoyed my stay ion the lounge toilets and showers were all clean and tidy for once a very pleasant stay wifi worked well,2nd July 2019,London Gatwick Airport,10
M Neale,disappointed with this lounge,ba business class passengers share a lounge with priority pass customers and several other airlines the lounge itself was extremely busy but theres a cordoned off area at one end for ba passengers which is dark and cramped however when we arrived two hours before our flight there were no seats we had to wait until other passengers left the food was poor  a couple of types of wrap and some crispy egg sandwiches on rye plus soup and a tired tray of salad ingredients we discovered subsequently that the food in the main area was fresher  probably due to the high number of peoplethe only nibbles were wasabi peas stale pretzels and a variety of different sweets theres a bar in the main area but the wine wasnt properly chilled the free wifi was open but quick we were extremely disappointed with this lounge as atlanta is a major hub and we were hoping to get dinner there so we could sleep on our flight,3rd June 2019,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,6
Gabriel Pepe,not comfortable at all,this is not a british airways lounge but a third party airport lounge that ba uses for their passengers the lounge is small full of people and not comfortable at all there was almost not food and just drinks however selection of drinks was really poor overwhelming noisy making impossible to relax before a flight staff was rude useless and they were clearly upset as we dont speak german and had to talk to us in english,4th January 2019,Vienna Airport,3
J Leane,no gluten free options,appalling lounge in terminal 3 food mediocre at best  and no gluten free options not enough easy chairs so had to sit on a stool dreary and depressing decor will try a different airline,2nd January 2019,London Heathrow Airport,3
Alex Johnson,best ba lounge i've experienced,this lounge opened at logan last year after a bit of a revamp of terminal e it caters for first business and silver gold passengers i accessed using the latter despite flying on the first evening service of the day the lounge wasnt busy and its very spacious theres a view of the apron from the far end with large windows and bar style seating next to them near the entrance is the usual self service bar and snacks similar to the ba galleries lounges in heathrow and gatwick down the far end however is a full service bar the staff there were fantastic and constantly brought me over another drink as soon as they saw my glass was empty pre flight dining is available from 5pm from a buffet which had a good selection and the food was nice theres also a concorde dining area for f passengers the real bonus with this lounge is that you board the aircraft directly from the lounge which is positioned above the boarding gate the staff were all fantastic so friendly and obliging this is quite possibly the best ba lounge ive experienced  id easily rate it above the flagship concorde room its that good,19th December 2018,Boston Logan Airport,10
David Ellis,little more than a corridor,the galleries first lounge is little more than a corridor next to the club world lounge there are adequate seats for the small number of ba flights leaving jnb at night food is selfservice and includes a fair selection of hot and cold options drinks are limited in choice and champagne is larssen rather than laurent perrier unfortunately because of the compact size of the space loud transatlantic smartphone conversations can easily disturb the peace,3rd December 2018,Johannesburg Airport,5
L Marsh,asked if i could use it for free,approached staff to ask if it would be possible to use the lounge for an hour prior to my connecting flight to scotland after travelling from the us i understood that i would be potentially charged but nevertheless asked if i could use it for free i was  turned away and not even offered any use of the facilities even if i had to pay i think that this is absolutely disgusting considering the respect and gratitude offered and given to me by american airlines including speedy boarding given to military,21st November 2018,London Heathrow Airport,1
D Keersen,not what you expect,menzies aurora lounge used by british airways one word: worthless could be a hotel foyer or something not what you expect with a business class fares,16th November 2018,Stockholm Arlanda Airport,1
Mike Andrésen,lounge needs a touch up badly,very attentive staff but the lounge needs a touch up badly furniture looks like its from the 80th selection of drinks food and coffee was quite average had breakfast before a flight and the scrambled eggs gets 5 stars champagne served was really mediocre and not first class standard but not having towels in the bathroom makes them like any bathroom in the terminal they have those awful hand blow dryers redo and do it right british airways,16th November 2018,London Gatwick Airport,6
N Sareni,bad artificial light,the lounge itself is not too bad except for the quality of the light: no natural light and really bad artificial light the really unacceptable thing is the music level really too high and also the music selection it was all about 80’ hits this is really far from relaxing or working time i had to spend 3 hours and i asked at least 4 times to the attendants to do something but without success,11th November 2018,New York JFK Airport,6
N Barden,there is barely enough space,as business class lounges go this one is pretty poor for a flight with 72+ business class seats there is barely enough space for this many people and certainly not comfortably its cramped and faces the evening sun so very warm the choice of food is very minimal the bar is served through a hatch with a queue every time for a drink and a limited selection there are less bathrooms in this lounge than on the aircraft so time your visit carefully,20th October 2018,Seattle Airport,2
L Xu,the staff here were nice,the lounge in changi airport are pretty spacious considering that there are consecutively two flights by 777 and a380 departing to london within 30 minutes however the lounge was not as crowded as i expected there were a wide selection of drinks and alcohol but the choice for food was a bit limited: only three kinds of main dish with pasta and mashed potato the staff here were nice with great hospitality,17th October 2018,Singapore Changi Airport,7
L Xu,a very refreshing experience,i went to the heathrow t5 arrival lounge for showering and breakfast after a 14 hours long flight from singapore the lounge located right after custom clearance and its very easy to find the reception staff were very hospitable but the lady staff in charge of assigning shower rooms was a bit inpatient the food was nice and there were a lot of choices for breakfast in general it was a very refreshing experience,16th October 2018,London Heathrow Airport,10
J Vasten,feels very cold and impersonal,lounge feels very cold and impersonal not very organised by the time you find anything it’s time to go i am sure the staff are wonderful however i feel they have to much work not enough workers to keep up food unfortunately is nothing special the bars are far apart again nothing to write home about also upon entering the lounge i was not told the wifi password so i will not rate that asked if my friend could possibly pay to get in and was told it is an invite i get it but what do you pay these extortionate prices for maybe get hold of the british airways lounge in singapore and get some ideas from them and also they are so much more friendly a nice smile goes along way i have been asked if i would recommend the airline  airline yes the lounge in london heathrow “no”,20th September 2018,,4
Richard Callis,absolutely rammed,absolutely rammed i used to be emerald with one world until two years ago when i changed alliances first class lounge at heathrow is probably my favourite in the world it was hard to make the decision to lose that i dont think i have been in the business class lounge at t5 for 5 years but it has deteriorated there were people lying across sofas as one would see in a bus station the place looked dishevelled it really looked like a pay to enter lounge i did not have time to sample the food on offer but ba normally has decent food and the drinks selection was good ba needs to think about either making more space available for frequent travellers or lifting the number of tier points to achieve sapphire status because this lounge is simply no longer a pleasant environment to spend any significant period of time,11th September 2018,London Heathrow Airport,4
Richard Hodges,very nice helpful staff,used bas club and first lounge got there early as 2 ba flights that day about 3 hours apart so was reasonably busy found 2 comfortable seats in a quiet corner without any problem good choice of beverages  beers wines and spirits  and had a glass of prosecco brought to us very nice helpful staff who cleared up tables and refreshed the rather limited food options frequently in common with most north american lounges the food options for business passengers was limited to 3 types of sandwiches vegetarian wraps potato crisps nuts and two types of cheese cut into squares no hotcooked choices notwithstanding the limited choice of food it was a comfortable and quiet enough place to while away a couple of hours before the flight,12th August 2018,San Francisco Airport,7
Richard Hodges,good choice of hot and cold breakfast,flew from lhr saturday 7th july and used the t5 galleries lounge north i think plenty of room not too crowded and easy to find comfy seats for my wife and i actually quite a good choice of hot and cold breakfast food so indulged and also plenty of drink options both alcoholic and the teacoffee variety lounge got busier as the morning wore on but still very pleasant,2nd August 2018,London Heathrow Airport,8
Mark Ellwood,small lounge with good seating,small lounge with a strange bell you have to ring in the terminal to get someone to let you in split into 2 sections one for first class and one for club class small lounge with good seating very limited offerings tea coffee soft drinks and alcohol some crisps a very small  selection of sandwiches and some cheese really depressing you would expect more especially at the prices we have paid one member of staff on the desk and one male floor walking but he really didnt want to be doing this or even working at all if you dont want your job i am sure someone else would love it toilets were clean and tidy just looking forward to the new terminal opening,27th July 2018,Bermuda Airport,3
David Iles,food on offer was poor,british airways use this lounge in the international terminal at atlanta airport which is a shame given in the old international terminal they had their own lounge which was head and shoulders above this offering upon arrival the lounge was already very full given the number of airlines using it and individuals who can access it via various flyer programmes there were many dirty plates glasses and cups on the tables and it appeared only one individual tasked with clearing them not a great start the carpet in many places was dirty and food scraps and litter was there for all to see the food on offer was poor in reality nothing more than snacks and the two packets of crisps my partner selected both had best before dates of july 2017 which i believe to be unacceptable one staff member did engage offering to get us some food which we politely declined the rest were somewhat indifferent given this is a customer facing service i was expecting better passengers travelling in the premium cabins of many of the airlines using this lounge will i am sure be deeply disappointed at the service offering when compared with their airlines “own lounges the airlines need to bring pressure for the service and quality to be improved as this is a disappointing way to end a trip,29th May 2018,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,1
Neil Jeram,there is a nice small lounge,terminal 5 is one big box once through a painless security check it was off to find the ba lounge first off was the north lounge the lady said best to try the south one as that was extremely busy so walked the length of the terminal which itself is a very very busy place and to the north lounge this was far bigger and initially had space the afternoon wore on and it became very packed commuter traffic across europe is very busy and reflected in the lounge so with that jumped onto the transit and to t5b concourse where there is a nice small lounge very quiet same food choices and had a decent shower and feed before departing my advice use this lounge and not the ones in the main concourse,25th May 2018,London Heathrow Airport,8
S Meacher,my worst lounge experience ever,i was using this lounge as a customer of qatar airways and the lounge is advertised as being open until 20:30 i arrived at 19:50 and it was clear that the surly woman at the reception was in goinghome mood she tried her best to send me to the other lounge that i qualified for however eventually let me in the lounge was in a terrible mess the chars were out of position newspaper rack in disarray food selection was a mess then at 20:05 i tried to use the restroom however the floor had already been mopped and the cleaning service cart was placed across the entrance with the cleaner leaning on a lounge chair next to it playing on his mobile i asked him if the bathroom was closed after a glare from him he pushed back the cart for me a moment later when i exited i overheard him cursing in italian by far my worst lounge experience ever,4th April 2018,Rome Fiumicino Airport,1
Roy Foster,too small for amount of people,this terminal 1 ba lounge is better then sitting out in general airport seats however it is too small for the amount of people they squeeze in food is just ok personally i prefer a seat with a table that i can use to do some work comfortably for this reason i think there is too much high top and non table seats in this lounge,30th March 2018,Dubai Airport,6
P Keane,service is outstanding,the service is outstanding very polite and very helpful staff was very professional assisting with towels for the shower i left my phone and their honesty just made me smile,30th March 2018,London Gatwick Airport,10
H Wealden,favourite of all the domestic lounges,ive been using this lounge since 2013 it was originally the british midland bmi lounge but when british airways took over bmi in 2012 they did a complete refurbishment of the lounge and when the lounge was complete they moved into this lounge it was a big improvement over the previous lounge offering more space power sockets at every seat and different areas designed for work or relaxation if youre a regular business traveller youll appreciate this lounge if you need to work theres plenty of desk space and if youre finished work and just want to relax theres plenty of comfy seats and a selection of food hot and cold drinks including alcoholic options its my favourite of all the domestic lounges that ba operate the ideal combination for a business traveller is having access to the ba lounge and flying on ba cityflyer to london city airport,19th March 2018,Edinburgh Airport,10
M Bailey,there was no place to sit,flying ba in their club europe class gave me access to this lounge  just showed boarding pass and no problem getting in however there was no place to sit as it was overcrowded hot and piles of empty glasses and plates at various tables drink selection looked good enough but food looked very basic due to the overcrowded lounge i turned around and left this is the third time i have been to this small stuffy lounge and only once was it reasonably quiet enough to find a place to sit and relax it’s just not big enough for the traffic they have signed up for,10th March 2018,Warsaw Chopin Airport,5
Derek Northcutt,always the same food served,good selection of beverages comfortable lounge but always the same food served chicken with a white gravy pasta with a red sauce chiliconcarne that is okay if you only visit the lounge once in your lifetime but for us who fly across the atlantic every month it is very monotonous,17th January 2018,London Heathrow Airport,4
Andrzej Bania,limited choice of food,warm welcome plenty of basic seating limited choice of food they claim 340 seats  but there is 1 unisex shower and you need to ask for a towel these are locked away in a separate cupboard it’s a weak lounge compared to galleries at t5 it’s not as nice as berlin it’s aweful compared to cathay pacific in paris etc it is miles better than hannover on the plus side  at least it’s airside,17th January 2018,Dusseldorf Airport,4
Andrzej Bania,experience was really good,modern clean and well attended limited array of food and drink options but everything was fresh and on point they cater for children and vegetarians and the whole experience was really good no where in the lounge where you can lay flat and limited seating for a major international  gives it a crowded feeling’ multiple individual showers with a ‘cupboard of useful stuff’  including razors combs etc  perfect if you’re travelling light it comes behind the galleries way behind cathay pacific paris etc  but trounces any german lounge,17th January 2018,San Francisco Airport,6
M Dorlan,lounge is much too small,the lounge is much too small and the food selection is lacking in variety the staff is rather dismissive in theeir attitude drinks were available with a wide selection there is a second lounge across the hall where you have the option to dine before boarding  it is much larger as well as is accommodates business class passengers as well i did not sample the food so i cant say anything about the selection or quality of the food available,7th January 2018,Chicago O'Hare Airport,6
D Mardessen,i am out and will drop ba for good,okay lounge with edible food can be a bit too busy at times they allow one guest only which i just found out applies to your children as well as i have more than one child i could not use the lounge or had to leave my 8 year old outside so much for missing my family while travelling for work when ba does not allow me to share the achieved benefits with them ba frequent flyer programme was already pretty useless  now i am out and will drop ba for good,1st January 2018,London Heathrow Airport,3
A Wharton,smaller and much quieter lounge,after the hustle and bustle of the north and south lounges in heathrow terminal 5a the smaller and much quieter lounge in b satellite is much appreciated it offers a full range of drinks and a reasonable food selection you can sit a down a chill without people rushing in and dashing out for a short haul a gate departure the interior is slightly dated but it is clean and the staff are helpful finding it is quite easy too unlike some of the ba lounges in european airports,22nd December 2017,London Heathrow Airport,7
A Wharton,former communist atmosphere,once you are past sofia airport security and in the terminal you turn left and go down some stairs into lounge overlooking the flight line entry is either frequent flyer status or pay to enter the staff are helpful and the lounge is clean food selection is very limited to some pastries and snacks drinks selection are a bar self pour draft beer  wines and spirits along with bottled water plenty of sofas and chairs & tables to work from it has a former communist atmosphere to it with the choice of colours and decorations,22nd December 2017,Sofia Airport,4
K Nevins,overcrowded with people and luggage,lounge small barely enough seating towards boarding time it was overcrowded with people and luggage basic drinks offer food was sub standard two small trays of sandwiches were brought and were almost inedible and ran out within minutes exactly same when i was there two years ago i thought it was a problem that particular day but i now realise two years on it’s the norm and british airways think that this is acceptable it’s comes to something when the inflight food and service is 100% better than that on the ground,22nd November 2017,Tampa Airport,1
Richard Clarke,not a comfortable stay at this lounge,monday morning this lhr north lounge t5 lounge was crowded and hardly a seat to be found seating was comfortable a food available was tasty although queues long good selection of drinks papers avaible but its hardly a lounge more like a morning cafe at rush hour as you couldnt truly relax toilets again are overwhelmed with passengers and i had to wait closecto 10 minutes just to use one cubicle as this was all they have couldnt see any showers to freshen up and they need to learn from the hong kong or changi experience not a nice experience for passengers these days as its no longer a lounge especially monday mornings a distinct lack of staff and the ones on duty were very disinterested in there job inside the lounge and hardly friendly  took an age to clean a table or remove used cups glasses plates passengers were seen removing plates so they could sit down and use there space for there plates etc hardly what you pay the extra for when ones flies business class wifi had a stable connection which was a kind of saving grace but its not a comfortable stay at this lounge,17th November 2017,London Heathrow Airport,4
Jason Law,a slightly better business lounge,the old first lounge at gatwick was terrible but ba have redeemed themselves with the new one which has a great view across the airfield food and drink remains the same as other 1st lounges  hotcold buffet selfservice beerwine incl champagnespirits in terms of competitors its a slightly better business lounge rather than a genuine 1st class one,14th November 2017,London Gatwick Airport,8
Jason Law,getting worse and worse,the first lounge at t5 is getting worse and worse the seating is now badly in need of some reupholstery with it looking cracked and worn in places the choice of champagne has declined; it used to be bollinger and now its a house ive never heard of the choice of magazines has been gutted with all the readable stuff from yesteryear the week economist spectator replaced with glossy fashionhighart wibble the food is ok but they no longer leave the lounge menus out im not even sure you can still order menu food and whilst its a bit of a firstworld whinge to complain about it  theyve not had drambuie in the lounge all year which means no more preflight rusty nails much like the rest of bas proposition  a bit tired off the pace and downmarket,14th November 2017,London Heathrow Airport,6
J Wadarthe,ba will offer the bare minimum,ba lounges at heathrow terminal 5 and edinburgh airport not having flown ba business class for a decade and having visited lounges in asia and the middle east airports i was ready to compare unfortunately several flights to edinburgh that day were delayed which meant the lounge was packed and noisy there was no chance of finding a quiet area to relax at first glance i noticed several drinks displays from loads of water and soft drinks to a large selection of wines and premium spirits several magazine racks were scatted throughout and a small computer station but it was the food that was the biggest disappointment just two small counters with a few salads tasteless pastas boiled rice some concoction with mince and tiny pieces of chicken drowned in sauce i ate only because i was hungry and had to spend nearly three hours until my flight left ok so it was busy and crowded but there was no extra attempt by the staff to clear tables and clean up i felt like i was in a canteen to be fair if the lounge was not so busy and one spent under an hour it would be passable but it showed how far the once worlds favourite airline has sunk so low in quality and customer care on my return the ba club lounge at edinburgh was much better spacious clean and comfortable seating with areas of privacy the view was uninspiring overlooking the car park it was a morning flight and again the food area was simply pathetic just a few pastries and cereals  nothing to really appetize you with it seems ba will offer the bare minimum and nothing more,13th November 2017,London Heathrow Airport,3
Michael Edwards,this is an okay lounge,the concorde room at terminal 7 in jfk airport is just a few metres past the fasttrack security lane and very convenient staff at the reception counter were quite curt and unfriendly whilst in contrast the waiting and serving staff inside the lounge were most hospitable and friendly the lounge was clean and comfortable a good choice of uk newspapers but very poor magazine choices there is an a la carte menu for lounge dining i chose a soup and dessert to enable maximum sleep time on the flight  both dishes were too a good standard this is an okay lounge but underlines the fact hat ba no longer try to offer a proper level of luxury to first class fares paying customers  many business class lounges are better than bas first class,31st October 2017,New York JFK Airport,6
Simon Fowler,an interesting selection of food,this express lounge is a new lounge which has just opened next to gate 8 in terminal 1 the gate used for flights to europe although available to all passengers on payment of $4995 it is primarily meant for business class customers on ba and norwegian the lounge is small and so can get full very quickly there was an interesting selection of food and a wide range of alcoholic beverages including some unusual craft beers the staff was wellorganised and helpful,26th October 2017,Oakland Airport,8
S Porter,would not pay to use this lounge,very poor lounge at malaga airport open to many airlines premium class passengers plus others who pay to use drinks okay but food very limited and not appetising poor sandwiches disappeared in a jiffy and not enough to go around the chicken one i had was pretty nondescript seating comfortable but if you are looking for food & drink and comfort before your flight then only the latter is any good plenty of sockets to charge your laptop etc i certainly would not pay to use this lounge,18th October 2017,Malaga Airport,3
Andrzej Bania,plenty of seating options,the galleries south lounge has lots of space plenty of seating options great coffeesnacks and a well stocked bar compared to the best lounges in germany that ba has to offer berlin  this is an absolute joy  in the business working areas it would be nice to have 24a usb charge points,29th September 2017,London Heathrow Airport,9
Zdenek Holy,most unpleasant experience ever,this was the singularly most unpleasant experience ever my wife and i were traveling first class on ba to london uk and were hoping to relax before the flight the food was mostly inedible the bathrooms were filthy the personnel rude and inattentive it appears that ba really does not give a damn about this facility,22nd July 2017,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,1
Guy Senior,definitely need improving,a most extraordinary third party lounge that british airways use at this airport the aircraft pier at basel is y shaped with the lounge on top of the junction of the y it is a huge 3 story circular structure with great views and unusually large smokingviewing terraces although only the middle story was open when i visited there was plenty of room drink options were ok but food was very limited to a few sandwiches and snacks this definitely need improving as otherwise it could be an excellent lounge,29th April 2017,Basel Mulhouse Airport,7
A Robertson,lukewarm food and awful presentation,ashamed that this is our national carrier this is supposed to be a first class lounge with torn seats lukewarm food and awful presentation all waiting staff stayed behind the doors whilst people stared at empty trays and a few staff who cared trying to help  management clearly at below stupid criteria was keen to fly ba because have managed more than few miles across long haul carriers from uk to middle east and asia pacific in business and first class and genuinely felt about time i tried,24th April 2017,London Heathrow Airport,3
M Shaw,staff in the lounge very attentive,ba lounge at south terminal gatwick airport good selection of snacks and beverages nice ambiance in the lounge and good facilities nice welcome by the receptionist staff in the lounge very attentive clearing tables quickly good selection of reading materials seating comfortable and not over crowded nice peaceful start to the start of our trip,21st April 2017,London Gatwick Airport,8
M Shaw,worst airline lounge visited,this has probably got to be the worst airline lounge i have ever visited the lady receptionist appeared miserable and not welcoming one tiny little bit there was a very poor selection of beverages and even less selection of snacks a bag of crisps or pizza flavoured very hard savoury biscuits seating was very comfortable toilet facilities not up to scratch no hand towels or air hand dryers in the toilet,21st April 2017,Pisa Airport,2
Guy Senior,plenty of comfortable seating,first impressions of the new lounge in the south terminal are not good as access is via a maze of corridors and a lift when you get there the lounge is a freestanding 2 storey structure on the roof of the main departure lounge this means floor to ceiling windows and good views the ground floor has some coffee stations a bar with a wide variety of drinks and hot food breakfast things when i arrived at 11am stew pasta and salad when i left an hour later on the mezzanine there was another coffee bar there was plenty of comfortable seating the mezzanine was a lot quieter so perhaps the place to sit at busy times the lift then took me straight down to within yards of my departure gate,7th April 2017,London Gatwick Airport,8
R Hughes,astonishingly good lounge,astonishingly good lounge opened 15th march with freshly cooked food and chef bar drinks etc bright airy on 4th floor and plenty of space for work etc  concorde lounge quality available to silver up  would definitely recommend,26th March 2017,Boston Logan Airport,9
J Aberg,food and drinks of low quality,new lounge at copenhagen airport located close to the departure lounge nice ambience as you walk into the lounge but it is downhill from there food and drinks are cheap and of low quality virtually no english magazines although a good selection of english newspapers what is really hilarious is the ba banner as you walk into the lounge telling you about the upgraded lounge experience,21st March 2017,Copenhagen Airport,3
Antony Meijer,i will not be returning,the aspire lounge at zurich airport is handy when you are a lone business traveller but for families or even couples it is simply not up to par it is far too small with almost non existent service food and beverages are not sufficient i will not be returning to this lounge,7th March 2017,Zurich Airport,3
E Smyth,lounge is fully operational,ba new lounge at lgw in spite of reported teething problems the lounge is fully operational clean well staffed and well laid out reasonable selection of breakfast food offerings in line with lhr offering good airport views from large windows there is a small but well equipped childrens play area which was quite at the time of review there is a good selection of magazines and news papers a positive experience and well worth the wait,26th February 2017,London Gatwick Airport,10
Catalin-Alexandru Epure,persons at reception are friendly,british airways has its own lounge at tegelairport which accomodates all oneworld peers and given the size of the airport the lounge is pretty spacious they seem to have used the space very efficently it is placed before security this means less time to spend there then usual and the toilets are located 2 floors beneath so you have to take the elevator to get there there are public restrooms they dont belong to the lounge but it is really not the fault of british airways for this i would rather say the airport infrastructure made it like this the persons at the reception are friendly and it is a pleasure to see them all the time smiling and ready to help you the drinks are plentiful it is not the case when it comes to food: they only have their signature sandwiches which are good and come in 4 or 5 varieties the problem is that there is nothing more and they used to have some crisps now they were replaced by peanuts and to be onest i really miss those crisps considering that they only have a few flights from tegel it is nice of ba to have a lounge there and it is a good opportunity to spend the time before your flight,23rd February 2017,Berlin Tegel Airport,7
Catalin-Alexandru Epure,wasn't a real first class lounge,as i read some reviews online looks like this lounge was made by british airways to accomodate the othere oneworld peers with status emerald and not use their own concorde lounge after reading about it i wasnt expecting much and i could realise it wasnt a real first class lounge it had some elements but i have seen better ones i should start with the fact that it was crowded yet not full you could find a seat about the food there was a buffet with not so many things and the a la carte menu wasnt present i had to ask an waiter about it then i ordered the famous british airways burger which wasnt great something was missing the desserts were better whith a lot of choices cakes and fruits and good quality the drinks as in every lounge are plentfull and always there when you need them in the desription there is a spaarea which i couldnt find the toilets were very modern and very clean a good place for spending the time between flights nothing more,23rd February 2017,London Heathrow Airport,6
Michael Davies,i've been in better,it was very quiet when i visited at 10am on a weekday im always happy to be able to use a lounge when travelling  but ive been in better there is no view over the airport the lounge has windows but you can only see the adjacent building good choice of drinks the food choice was not very good a few pastries some ham and cheese and sliced bread there are no flight information screens in this lounge but they will announce your flight reasonably well located  only a short walk from the gates,22nd February 2017,Rome Fiumicino Airport,7
A Wong,american airlines lounge is better,as my flight from hong kong arrives at 4:30am and no hotel will check you in the ba arrivals lounge is really useful i did expect this lounge to be very good at the new t5 not so it is not bad but the american airlines lounge at t3 after renovation is better and serves better food but as i said it is useful as you are not driven out to wander in the london street in winter time,7th February 2017,London Heathrow Airport,8
Andrzej Bania,give the concorde room a rethink,when i was invited by a friend to meet in the concorde room my expectation levels were high unfortunately while it is nice  it falls short of bas billing in too many ways far too much space has been allocated to the lounging area which meant that the individual dining tables were cramped the food was ok and the initial service was fast enough but the empty plates and glasses stay on the table far too long  over half an hour in our case the lounge area is richly decorated  which makes the hospital style restrooms a bit of a shock  complete with chipped doorswalls and tired styling overall its okay but if you judged the heathrow terminal 5 concorde room as a hotel youd struggle to award it 5 stars terminal 5 is great but ba needs to give the concorde room a rethink,28th January 2017,London Heathrow Airport,8
M Parry,there was no real service,very disappointed by the initial appearance of this british airways terminal 3 first class lounge at london heathrow first impressions count for a lot but subsequent ones were not much better admittedly we had previously been spoiled by the ba lhr t5 concorde room lounge the welcome was insincere the lighting was dingy and there was no real service unless you ate in the so called restaurant part glasses and trash were not picked up in a timely manner tables were not wiped this lounge was definitely the poor relation of the t5 lounges i only wish they would have similar standards across their 2 terminals given the choice i would rather not go from t3 unless i was flying virgin atlantic,26th January 2017,London Heathrow Airport,4
Alice Boyd,friendly and helpful staff,excellent friendly and helpful staff well stocked with drinks cheese fruit biscuits snacks kept tidy in the lounge more care could have taken with maintaining cleanliness in the toilets  although i may just have been unlucky in my timing since i did see a cleaner going in 10 minutes later good electrics hookups for all plug variants kept both me and my daughter and our technologies happy,14th January 2017,Houston IAH,8
Daniel Strassberg,the lounge is a good size,british airways has its own lounge in singapore the lounge is a good size with plenty of seating and power points staff are okay not particularly friendly and did not provide any announcements about the delay in boarding gate closed at 19:35 and by 19:30 people began to question if they had missed the boarding call had to ask as did many others what was happening only to be told there was a 20 minute delay snacks and meals put out where the exact same in november as is december which thankfully was not too bad wifi was good and lots of power points to charge devices bathroom and showers are good,7th December 2016,Singapore Changi Airport,8
Guy Senior,it lacks any pizazz,this heathrow terminal 3 lounge has most that you might require  a restaurant a spa champagne bar food and particularly good table wine there is also lots of space however it lacks any pizaz or sparkle and is definitely not the concorde room it can also be a long walk from the gates but the design of t3 makes this unavoidable,24th November 2016,London Heathrow Airport,8
Derrick Clarke,space was limited,common lounge for first and business class passengers meant space was limited due to inefficient queues through security and passport control we only had around half an hour in the lounge with the limited seating and food options and quality it was long enough think lukewarm curry and soggy pastries,22nd November 2016,Johannesburg Airport,5
E Carmere,there is not enough space,the lounge is clean but the seats are worn and there is not enough space to accommodate all the passengers travelling in club and those with silver and having access to the lounge nothing wrong decent sandwiches but no hot food only soup decent choice of alcoholic beverages and acceptable wines service with a smile vonly a shame the restrooms are extremely basic and not very clean,14th March 2024,Barbados Grantley Adams Airport,6
Tony Maddern,staff were welcoming and friendly,the lounge is very spacious with a wide variety of areas to sit and a kids play area food was amazing with hot cooked foods at breakfast alcoholic beverages were limited to wine  sparking wine as it was morning very clean and showers are available which was great after connecting from an overnight flight from new york staff were welcoming and friendly,21st December 2023,London Heathrow Airport,10
S Neale,rotten and totally incompetent airline,tatty and uncared for the ba business lounge in gatwick south terminal seems to be unloved and uncared for the staff try hard but there is little loyalty they do not work for ba information on flights is scarce due to them not working direct and on one occasion they were told by ba to “stop bothering them” when they were trying to ascertain the status of a much delayed flight despite the flight having been delayed for over five hours the customers were kicked out of the lounge two hours before boarding as it was closing i would certainly never fly with this truly rotten and totally incompetent airline again,28th September 2023,London Gatwick Airport,1
Peter Glasier,"ba staff who are rude, abrasive",crowded or rather overcrowded as usual the catering staff in the lounge are nice polite and helpful  in contrast to the reception ba staff who are rude abrasive and have no right to be facing customers the toilets are terrible long queues to access one no urinals so all men have to queue up for the single toilets as with so many other parts of the famous ba costcutting all magazines and newspapers have not been returned after covid and this is now a further drop in standards food is okay but hot food is real canteen style and not a match on many airlines first class standards to call this a first lounge is a disgrace and you are probably better off going to one of the restaurants in the main departure hall and one thing you will note heathrow public toilets are nicer and kept cleaner than the ba lounge facilities,1st September 2023,London Heathrow Airport,2
Richard Hodges,full service has been resumed,flew london to kalamata and as a silversaphire member used the galleries south lounge covid had meant that food offerings had been stripped back to a bare minimum but i am pleased that a full service has been resumed quite busy but found two comfortable seats easily enough had a decent full english breakfast with a glass of champagne and very good cup or two of coffee much better ba,20th June 2023,London Heathrow Airport,9
Ellen Blaine Adams,the lounge is infested with mice,we were at the british airways terminal 5 south business lounge at heathrow airport on the evening of april 24 2023 we were shocked to see not one but three mice running under and around our chairs and table the wait staff told me the lounge is infested with mice and that british airways and heathrow airport have known about this for months i was so disgusted that i left i was then told by a flight attendant that their crew lounge is also infested with mice lastly i was told by an airport meet and greet that the problem is not just limited to the british air lounges in addition to the active mice the lounge was very dark the tables were dirty as was the glassware totally disgusting and unacceptable the health department needs to close the lounge in my opinion,4th May 2023,London Heathrow Airport,1
G Marsen,cold and unwelcoming,a pretty underwhelming experience the staff on the desk to greet us were quite cold and unwelcoming the same was true of the staff on the baggage storage desk and the shower suite desk the shower facilities were in desperate need of refurbishment as is the lounge in general the food on offer was quite nice and the atmosphere was quiet and relaxed which is what we needed after a very long flight bottom line though is ba really need to improve the quality of their staff and give this particular lounge a refresh,28th April 2023,London Heathrow Airport,5
P Horten,not a bad experience,i travelled on a weekend which i never normally do so was taken aback by how busy the lounge was i did find a decent seat luckily and tried from both the breakfast and lunch menu both offered a decent selection of nice food and beverages on the wine side a really ordinary prosecco was available to self serve but you needed to order champagne i did find a really good sauvignon which exceeded my expectations and only wish that happened more the staff were very good at keeping a really busy lounge not looking too distressed with the volume of customers generally not a bad experience but hardly outstanding i guess you need to head to the gulf states for that,12th April 2023,London Heathrow Airport,6
Ian Sinclair,shoddy level of service,arrived from johannesburg and went to the concorde room for breakfast thirty minutes after ordering nothing arrived apparently order lost between the dining area and the kitchen lounge not busy so no excuse for this shoddy level of service it was a chaotic shambles and given that this is bas flagship lounge it was extremely disappointing i eventually went to the first lounge and had breakfast there the staff in the concorde lounge really need a refresher course there is no excuse for getting something so straightforward wrong,11th March 2023,London Heathrow Airport,2
M Kidd,as basic as it gets,ba business class ticket holders access escape lounge which is also a pay per use lounge compared with ba’s lounges around the world this is as basic as it gets self service hot and cold snacks soft drinks and teacoffee alcohol on request from the bar the wines are cheap and don’t compare to business class offerings at ba lounge is tidy there’s a waste trolley on view where staff scrape dirty plates into the bin and stack dirty plates very off putting staff like to chat amongst themselves the ‘meet and greet’ person on the lounge was glued to her chair and social media shouting ‘hiya’ and ‘see ya’ every now and again the lounge is a nice escape from the crowds downstairs with lots of charging points for devices,25th January 2023,Manchester Airport,1
C Keane,drink choices have been limited,only a few usb ports are working food offerings were better than before drink choices have been limited to minimalist no more zacapa rum or woodford reserve not even jack daniels if u don’t like bulleit bourbon that includes onboard packed lounge with sun boiling anyone sitting in its way as there’s no window shading staff were working hard i felt given the amount of people bottled water removed shame as it was handy only tiny 250ml beer cans available no tiger or amstel choices…,17th January 2023,London Heathrow Airport,4
Jeremy Archdale,lack of breakfast on offer,having paid ba over £7000 for our trip to barbados we rather thought we might be able to get some breakfast before boarding we tried a very overcrowded lounge soon after security and managed a small plate of baked beans toast and bacon were not on offer a member of the lounge staff tipped us off that the business lounge in c satellite would be more comfortable so we went there much less crowded but the same lack of breakfast on offer,13th December 2022,London Heathrow Airport,1
C King,the food was surprisingly good,the food was surprisingly good back to self service breakfast and lunch plenty of drinks selection but sadly no more gentleman jack or woodford reserve also no zacapa rum which is  disappointing bulleit bourbon is simply awful for a saturday afternoon there was plenty of seats staff all very polite and friendly,10th December 2022,London Heathrow Airport,7
S Keale,experience could not have been better!,others have reviewed this quite harshly our experience could not have been better in fact this is one of the best lounges we have visited and we have been to many other business lounges its nearly up there with istanbul and singapore very well laid out with plenty of space and places to siteat the choice and variety of food was excellent we arrived just at the breakfast lunch changeover so we had a pretty great choice this lounge is in total contrast to the swiss business lounge at zurich which we visited the day before that was just pathetic  a very good lounge,19th November 2022,London Heathrow Airport,10
C Mayle,way too crowded,way too crowded with many people walking around looking for a place to sit no champagne at the champagne bar although a staff member did bring a tray of filled glasses after mentioning that passengers were walking off with the bottles ba used to have a display in the terminal showing how crowded each of the t5 lounges were but that wasnt visible this time staff were trying valiantly but the number of people was simply too much for them to do more than the bare minimum of clearing glasses and dishes next time i think ill just have a glass of champagne and some nice oysters outside  even if i have to pay it will definitely be more comfortable and less stressful,24th October 2022,London Heathrow Airport,3
Jonathan Fisher,"overcrowded, inedible food",awful experience overcrowded inedible food disgusting toilets we left almost immediately and went to sit in the terminal ba should be ashamed of this facility,16th October 2022,London Heathrow Airport,2
J Meesen,british airways lounge is excellent,the british airways lounge is excellent i had a nice cream tea though i avoided the tea and had strawberry baileys instead the scone was excellent the clotted cream great and the strawberry jam nice after that i went through to the rest area where hightech seats are available but i have a 20 minute limit however since there were very few people waiting i just used another and another 20 minutes with no problem disadvantages of the ba lounge were that there were very few charging points available beside the seats in the rest area there was a charging point but elsewhere they were few and far between the drink selection was good apart from a rather unusual absence of cognac armagnac or brandy however the strawberry baileys and birthday cake baileys along with a wide selection of other choices made up for the missing brandy the food was excellent,25th June 2022,London Heathrow Airport,9
Chris Walsh,5b lounge is so much better than the t5a lounge,terminal 5b lounge is so much better than the t5a lounge nice and quiet it is worth the train and walk back to the main terminal the lounge at t5a is huge and quite impersonal,8th June 2022,London Heathrow Airport,10
Guy Senior,very badly laid out lounge,not british airways best very badly laid out lounge limited facilities and no views however staff very nice the terminal is being rebuilt so hopefully this will improve,21st April 2022,Chicago O'Hare Airport,6
Richard Hodges,food offering has further declined,used on wednesday 16 march before our flight to barbados busy but could still find a comfortable seat and a reasonable selection of drinks on offer coffee machines working this time most were not november 2021 and very good coffee it was unfortunately and as i suspected in november 2021 the food offering has further declined: the hot offering was just a bacon roll only this time without even hash browns a couple of nice pastries on offer it is clear that ba are now using covid as the excuse to downgrade their offerings and cost cut what used to be a very nice lounge with a decent buffet breakfast selection has now gone for good i fear,5th April 2022,London Heathrow Airport,5
Chris Walsh,"light, airy and decent food",well organised lounge light airy and decent food food was pretty good and coffee was excellent as youd expect in italy not so sure itd be the best for a long stop but great for short,5th April 2022,Venice Marco Polo Airport,7
Chris Walsh,rude staff and disgusting toilets,possibly the worst lounge with the most miserable staff many people havent flown for a long time and lounges methods have changed poor food rude staff and disgusting toilets,5th April 2022,London Heathrow Airport,1
Jeff Michel,very crowded and thus uncomfortable,nice views of the runway in one section but very crowded and thus uncomfortable good selection of drinks but their app system of ordering food no buffet means that when it gets delivered to your table means it is cold weird setup in there and certainly not conducive to a relaxed wait for your flight i am sure that ba can do better stressed passengers do not deal with the inevitable delayed flight as well as relaxed ones,4th April 2022,London Heathrow Airport,3
Guy Senior,fantastically helpful staff,the lounge has been refurbished since my last visit but difficult to see any major changes however very pleasant and fantastically helpful staff  full marks to them,9th February 2022,Geneva Airport,9
Richard Hodges,food offering has declined dramatically,used this lounge on 5th november before our flight to tenerife still a reasonably comfortable place to wait for your flight with a good selection of drinks however since covid19 the standard of the food offering has declined dramatically with just a bacon roll and hash browns as the main hot offering food also has to be ordered by a lounge app and you will be served at your table at least 2 of the coffee machines were not working and causing problems no longer a real premium offering  one can only hope that when covid eventually dies down the lounge can return to its former decent buffet but im not holding my breath  ba may just use this as an excuse to become the new normal lounge service,15th November 2021,London Heathrow Airport,6
R Marston,lack of that truly luxurious feel,this was the first time using this terminal 5 lounge after recently becoming a british airways executive club gold member i was travelling on an economy hand baggage only flight with a non status friend and he was allowed to enter as my guest there isnt a huge difference between the business and the first class lounge you still have the british airways nhs style showers and toilets furnishings that arent too modern and the lack of that truly luxurious feel but there is an upgrade in the drinks variety more premium brands of drinks this visit was during covid and so you had to order food and snacks by scanning a qr code entering your table number and placing your order ba lounges have never been truly luxurious if you have one world status you are better off visiting the likes of cathay pacific whose bathrooms are beautifully designed tiled and contain aesop products but if you want an english breakfast for instance ba is your best bet,22nd August 2021,London Heathrow Airport,7
G Warlan,lounge has no windows,i visited this lounge in march when travel reduced because of the virus this lounge is used by aer lingus and other oneworld elites which make this lounge crowded especially in the evening the snack options in the lounge are decent and something you can work with this lounge has no windows and very low ceilings which make it gloomy club dining is a nice option and highly recommended its less crowded than the rest of the lounge because of restricted access and a good choice of hot food in response to bas sleeper service,25th April 2020,Chicago O'Hare Airport,6
Mark Ellwood,lounge was very basic,this american airlines admirals club lounge was very basic with limited food and drink options plenty of different seating areas but it was a real let down and not worth using in my opinion i expected more but would advise just sitting in main terminal and paying for some food i am surprised this is an american airlines lounge but they must be easily pleased would not bother using or even go to the bother of finding the lounge if you just want a drink and a cracker then you will love it total waste of time,12th January 2020,Rio De Janeiro Airport,1
Mark Ellwood,food was very hit and miss,i used the terminal 5 north lounge as i find this lounge less busy plenty of seats today so no problems for me food was very hit and miss some strange bread rolls with bacon they were heavily seeded and strange not to my liking what is wrong with plain  plenty of hot cold and soft drinks as well as the usual alcohol  todays use of lounge was fine a bit busier as the morning went on toilets needed cleaning,3rd January 2020,London Heathrow Airport,7
Neil Jeram,quality felt lacking,the lounge is divided into business and first and has been renovated late evening the club world lounge was quiet plentiful seating decent selection of drinks i found the f & b is nowhere near the standards of aa with their flagship lounge or other one world ones i most often use maybe it was later in the evening but quality felt lacking the ambience was very flat terminal 7 at jfk is the ba terminal and whilst great for ba and its one world partners to have its own space its a very tired terminal washrooms are still the same cramped space and the showers clearly have not been renovated,17th December 2019,New York JFK Airport,4
Mike Andrésen,excellent service all over,the galleries first lounge at heathrow was beautiful and calm place to relax or work a bit between your flights excellent service all over nothing much more you can ask for even with a first class ticket price,7th December 2019,London Heathrow Airport,9
Mike Andrésen,superb service and good space,the concorde lounge is a place to relax and a place to eat superb service and good space you can sit inside the lounge or the area outside above the departure hall if you like some more buzz nice dining area and good food only downside is there are a little short of bathrooms,7th December 2019,London Heathrow Airport,10
David Ellis,a definite improvement,the club world and first galleries lounge at johannesburg has been the subject of much needed refurbishment and reflects a new harmonised policy for housing both classes under one roof without as overt a distinction as before to be honest the previous first lounge was something of an embarrassment with too few seats and general feeling of being cramped the new arrangement eschews a separate first lounge but allocates a separate first dining area this seems to work reasonably well the rest of the lounge is by no means spacious but there are adequate seats to accommodation the club and first passengers on the two evening flights to lhr the food seems to substantially better than before with regular refreshes of both hot and cold food the bar area is spacious as bar areas go and service was good overall the new galleries lounge is a definite improvement for club passengers; first passengers may not agree of course,7th December 2019,Johannesburg Airport,7
P Huang,"overall, a great visit",after a subpar visit to the qantas lounge next door my partner and i decided to give the british airways lounge a go it was a completely different experience a much better one in my opinion the space had such character with striking decors along with a great layout for dining work and relaxation the catering was fantastic with plenty of options for food and beverages with plenty of comfortable seating to enjoy it customer service was average lounge team were present and making sure food was plentiful plus consistently tidying but lack face to face service shower facilities were adequate but lacked in numbers overall a great visit as i would definitely pick this lounge over the qantas and third party offerings,20th October 2019,Singapore Changi Airport,8
Mark Ellwood,food options were very good,main galleries lounge in terminal 5 at heathrow was very busy food options were very good and plentiful the main lounge agates as usual were very busy not helped when some of the u shaped seating areas have massive square tables making it difficult for people to get seated very bad design we had a cgate departure so left the lounge and went to the quieter lounge in the bgate area which i would always recommend people to do,19th October 2019,London Heathrow Airport,6
R Gonzaga,most sections were shut,cathay pacific uses this lounge for their washington flights to hkg the lounge is nice but most sections were shut as it is 11pm at night there was no hot food apart from soup and there are  sandwiches on offer and lots of fresh fruit the usual tea and coffee and white and red wine plus a few beers  if you plan to dine before you fly so you can catch maximum sleep on the plane dont plan on doing it in this lounge which is miserable the toilets were not clean with paper towels everywhere the staff were pleasant enough cx needs to do something about their lounge access in iad,16th September 2019,Washington Dulles Airport,3
Sam Healey,nicely appointed with good food,the ba lounge at newark airport is very nicely appointed with good food the steak and ale pie on offer that evening was delicious and plenty of seating throughout the female toilets were also spotlessly clean and tidy i was very happy to see rosa there again this staff member and all the team work very hard to keep customers happy,19th August 2019,Newark Airport,9
C Marvere,there is plenty of food,i used the business lounge south on heathrow t5 and as usual it was rather busy plenty of newspapers  magazines and books available to read and decent internet there is plenty of food pastries and chocolates fruits and yoghurts also bread filled with bacon however no cheese or ham available  jams and marmalade out of big tins ample choice of teas and coffee also  despite it was rather early  lots of wines and alcoholic beverages even better brands like grey goose and sodas there is a lot to eat and to drink only a shame the food is not refined,18th July 2019,London Heathrow Airport,7
Mark Ellwood,not what you expect from a club lounge,really looking forward to the new airport opening the old lounge is very odd at least you no longer have to ring the bell to get in but you do have to knock on the door it is rather small and the offerings are miserable just a few sandwiches on a plate total 12 cut quarters at a time a selection of cheese crisps and some fruit a strange man always the same one who wanders around and refills you have a selection of drinks and a few tv screens not what you expect from a club lounge but it has always been the same toilets ok again limited roll on 2020,2nd July 2019,Bermuda Airport,4
Mark Ellwood,for once a very pleasant stay,plenty of space and lots of seats to choose at the gatwick club world lounge the food selections it was lunchtime 12:30 were very good not the usual finger treats and a few sandwiches but a good selection of chilli meatballs chicken stew with beans baked potatoes rice cooked very well and the sandwiches and nibbles i was absolutely full and thoroughly enjoyed my stay ion the lounge toilets and showers were all clean and tidy for once a very pleasant stay wifi worked well,2nd July 2019,London Gatwick Airport,10
M Neale,disappointed with this lounge,ba business class passengers share a lounge with priority pass customers and several other airlines the lounge itself was extremely busy but theres a cordoned off area at one end for ba passengers which is dark and cramped however when we arrived two hours before our flight there were no seats we had to wait until other passengers left the food was poor  a couple of types of wrap and some crispy egg sandwiches on rye plus soup and a tired tray of salad ingredients we discovered subsequently that the food in the main area was fresher  probably due to the high number of peoplethe only nibbles were wasabi peas stale pretzels and a variety of different sweets theres a bar in the main area but the wine wasnt properly chilled the free wifi was open but quick we were extremely disappointed with this lounge as atlanta is a major hub and we were hoping to get dinner there so we could sleep on our flight,3rd June 2019,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,6
Gabriel Pepe,not comfortable at all,this is not a british airways lounge but a third party airport lounge that ba uses for their passengers the lounge is small full of people and not comfortable at all there was almost not food and just drinks however selection of drinks was really poor overwhelming noisy making impossible to relax before a flight staff was rude useless and they were clearly upset as we dont speak german and had to talk to us in english,4th January 2019,Vienna Airport,3
J Leane,no gluten free options,appalling lounge in terminal 3 food mediocre at best  and no gluten free options not enough easy chairs so had to sit on a stool dreary and depressing decor will try a different airline,2nd January 2019,London Heathrow Airport,3
Alex Johnson,best ba lounge i've experienced,this lounge opened at logan last year after a bit of a revamp of terminal e it caters for first business and silver gold passengers i accessed using the latter despite flying on the first evening service of the day the lounge wasnt busy and its very spacious theres a view of the apron from the far end with large windows and bar style seating next to them near the entrance is the usual self service bar and snacks similar to the ba galleries lounges in heathrow and gatwick down the far end however is a full service bar the staff there were fantastic and constantly brought me over another drink as soon as they saw my glass was empty pre flight dining is available from 5pm from a buffet which had a good selection and the food was nice theres also a concorde dining area for f passengers the real bonus with this lounge is that you board the aircraft directly from the lounge which is positioned above the boarding gate the staff were all fantastic so friendly and obliging this is quite possibly the best ba lounge ive experienced  id easily rate it above the flagship concorde room its that good,19th December 2018,Boston Logan Airport,10
David Ellis,little more than a corridor,the galleries first lounge is little more than a corridor next to the club world lounge there are adequate seats for the small number of ba flights leaving jnb at night food is selfservice and includes a fair selection of hot and cold options drinks are limited in choice and champagne is larssen rather than laurent perrier unfortunately because of the compact size of the space loud transatlantic smartphone conversations can easily disturb the peace,3rd December 2018,Johannesburg Airport,5
L Marsh,asked if i could use it for free,approached staff to ask if it would be possible to use the lounge for an hour prior to my connecting flight to scotland after travelling from the us i understood that i would be potentially charged but nevertheless asked if i could use it for free i was  turned away and not even offered any use of the facilities even if i had to pay i think that this is absolutely disgusting considering the respect and gratitude offered and given to me by american airlines including speedy boarding given to military,21st November 2018,London Heathrow Airport,1
D Keersen,not what you expect,menzies aurora lounge used by british airways one word: worthless could be a hotel foyer or something not what you expect with a business class fares,16th November 2018,Stockholm Arlanda Airport,1
Mike Andrésen,lounge needs a touch up badly,very attentive staff but the lounge needs a touch up badly furniture looks like its from the 80th selection of drinks food and coffee was quite average had breakfast before a flight and the scrambled eggs gets 5 stars champagne served was really mediocre and not first class standard but not having towels in the bathroom makes them like any bathroom in the terminal they have those awful hand blow dryers redo and do it right british airways,16th November 2018,London Gatwick Airport,6
N Sareni,bad artificial light,the lounge itself is not too bad except for the quality of the light: no natural light and really bad artificial light the really unacceptable thing is the music level really too high and also the music selection it was all about 80’ hits this is really far from relaxing or working time i had to spend 3 hours and i asked at least 4 times to the attendants to do something but without success,11th November 2018,New York JFK Airport,6
N Barden,there is barely enough space,as business class lounges go this one is pretty poor for a flight with 72+ business class seats there is barely enough space for this many people and certainly not comfortably its cramped and faces the evening sun so very warm the choice of food is very minimal the bar is served through a hatch with a queue every time for a drink and a limited selection there are less bathrooms in this lounge than on the aircraft so time your visit carefully,20th October 2018,Seattle Airport,2
L Xu,the staff here were nice,the lounge in changi airport are pretty spacious considering that there are consecutively two flights by 777 and a380 departing to london within 30 minutes however the lounge was not as crowded as i expected there were a wide selection of drinks and alcohol but the choice for food was a bit limited: only three kinds of main dish with pasta and mashed potato the staff here were nice with great hospitality,17th October 2018,Singapore Changi Airport,7
L Xu,a very refreshing experience,i went to the heathrow t5 arrival lounge for showering and breakfast after a 14 hours long flight from singapore the lounge located right after custom clearance and its very easy to find the reception staff were very hospitable but the lady staff in charge of assigning shower rooms was a bit inpatient the food was nice and there were a lot of choices for breakfast in general it was a very refreshing experience,16th October 2018,London Heathrow Airport,10
J Vasten,feels very cold and impersonal,lounge feels very cold and impersonal not very organised by the time you find anything it’s time to go i am sure the staff are wonderful however i feel they have to much work not enough workers to keep up food unfortunately is nothing special the bars are far apart again nothing to write home about also upon entering the lounge i was not told the wifi password so i will not rate that asked if my friend could possibly pay to get in and was told it is an invite i get it but what do you pay these extortionate prices for maybe get hold of the british airways lounge in singapore and get some ideas from them and also they are so much more friendly a nice smile goes along way i have been asked if i would recommend the airline  airline yes the lounge in london heathrow “no”,20th September 2018,,4
Richard Callis,absolutely rammed,absolutely rammed i used to be emerald with one world until two years ago when i changed alliances first class lounge at heathrow is probably my favourite in the world it was hard to make the decision to lose that i dont think i have been in the business class lounge at t5 for 5 years but it has deteriorated there were people lying across sofas as one would see in a bus station the place looked dishevelled it really looked like a pay to enter lounge i did not have time to sample the food on offer but ba normally has decent food and the drinks selection was good ba needs to think about either making more space available for frequent travellers or lifting the number of tier points to achieve sapphire status because this lounge is simply no longer a pleasant environment to spend any significant period of time,11th September 2018,London Heathrow Airport,4
Richard Hodges,very nice helpful staff,used bas club and first lounge got there early as 2 ba flights that day about 3 hours apart so was reasonably busy found 2 comfortable seats in a quiet corner without any problem good choice of beverages  beers wines and spirits  and had a glass of prosecco brought to us very nice helpful staff who cleared up tables and refreshed the rather limited food options frequently in common with most north american lounges the food options for business passengers was limited to 3 types of sandwiches vegetarian wraps potato crisps nuts and two types of cheese cut into squares no hotcooked choices notwithstanding the limited choice of food it was a comfortable and quiet enough place to while away a couple of hours before the flight,12th August 2018,San Francisco Airport,7
Richard Hodges,good choice of hot and cold breakfast,flew from lhr saturday 7th july and used the t5 galleries lounge north i think plenty of room not too crowded and easy to find comfy seats for my wife and i actually quite a good choice of hot and cold breakfast food so indulged and also plenty of drink options both alcoholic and the teacoffee variety lounge got busier as the morning wore on but still very pleasant,2nd August 2018,London Heathrow Airport,8
Mark Ellwood,small lounge with good seating,small lounge with a strange bell you have to ring in the terminal to get someone to let you in split into 2 sections one for first class and one for club class small lounge with good seating very limited offerings tea coffee soft drinks and alcohol some crisps a very small  selection of sandwiches and some cheese really depressing you would expect more especially at the prices we have paid one member of staff on the desk and one male floor walking but he really didnt want to be doing this or even working at all if you dont want your job i am sure someone else would love it toilets were clean and tidy just looking forward to the new terminal opening,27th July 2018,Bermuda Airport,3
David Iles,food on offer was poor,british airways use this lounge in the international terminal at atlanta airport which is a shame given in the old international terminal they had their own lounge which was head and shoulders above this offering upon arrival the lounge was already very full given the number of airlines using it and individuals who can access it via various flyer programmes there were many dirty plates glasses and cups on the tables and it appeared only one individual tasked with clearing them not a great start the carpet in many places was dirty and food scraps and litter was there for all to see the food on offer was poor in reality nothing more than snacks and the two packets of crisps my partner selected both had best before dates of july 2017 which i believe to be unacceptable one staff member did engage offering to get us some food which we politely declined the rest were somewhat indifferent given this is a customer facing service i was expecting better passengers travelling in the premium cabins of many of the airlines using this lounge will i am sure be deeply disappointed at the service offering when compared with their airlines “own lounges the airlines need to bring pressure for the service and quality to be improved as this is a disappointing way to end a trip,29th May 2018,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,1
Neil Jeram,there is a nice small lounge,terminal 5 is one big box once through a painless security check it was off to find the ba lounge first off was the north lounge the lady said best to try the south one as that was extremely busy so walked the length of the terminal which itself is a very very busy place and to the north lounge this was far bigger and initially had space the afternoon wore on and it became very packed commuter traffic across europe is very busy and reflected in the lounge so with that jumped onto the transit and to t5b concourse where there is a nice small lounge very quiet same food choices and had a decent shower and feed before departing my advice use this lounge and not the ones in the main concourse,25th May 2018,London Heathrow Airport,8
S Meacher,my worst lounge experience ever,i was using this lounge as a customer of qatar airways and the lounge is advertised as being open until 20:30 i arrived at 19:50 and it was clear that the surly woman at the reception was in goinghome mood she tried her best to send me to the other lounge that i qualified for however eventually let me in the lounge was in a terrible mess the chars were out of position newspaper rack in disarray food selection was a mess then at 20:05 i tried to use the restroom however the floor had already been mopped and the cleaning service cart was placed across the entrance with the cleaner leaning on a lounge chair next to it playing on his mobile i asked him if the bathroom was closed after a glare from him he pushed back the cart for me a moment later when i exited i overheard him cursing in italian by far my worst lounge experience ever,4th April 2018,Rome Fiumicino Airport,1
Roy Foster,too small for amount of people,this terminal 1 ba lounge is better then sitting out in general airport seats however it is too small for the amount of people they squeeze in food is just ok personally i prefer a seat with a table that i can use to do some work comfortably for this reason i think there is too much high top and non table seats in this lounge,30th March 2018,Dubai Airport,6
P Keane,service is outstanding,the service is outstanding very polite and very helpful staff was very professional assisting with towels for the shower i left my phone and their honesty just made me smile,30th March 2018,London Gatwick Airport,10
H Wealden,favourite of all the domestic lounges,ive been using this lounge since 2013 it was originally the british midland bmi lounge but when british airways took over bmi in 2012 they did a complete refurbishment of the lounge and when the lounge was complete they moved into this lounge it was a big improvement over the previous lounge offering more space power sockets at every seat and different areas designed for work or relaxation if youre a regular business traveller youll appreciate this lounge if you need to work theres plenty of desk space and if youre finished work and just want to relax theres plenty of comfy seats and a selection of food hot and cold drinks including alcoholic options its my favourite of all the domestic lounges that ba operate the ideal combination for a business traveller is having access to the ba lounge and flying on ba cityflyer to london city airport,19th March 2018,Edinburgh Airport,10
M Bailey,there was no place to sit,flying ba in their club europe class gave me access to this lounge  just showed boarding pass and no problem getting in however there was no place to sit as it was overcrowded hot and piles of empty glasses and plates at various tables drink selection looked good enough but food looked very basic due to the overcrowded lounge i turned around and left this is the third time i have been to this small stuffy lounge and only once was it reasonably quiet enough to find a place to sit and relax it’s just not big enough for the traffic they have signed up for,10th March 2018,Warsaw Chopin Airport,5
Derek Northcutt,always the same food served,good selection of beverages comfortable lounge but always the same food served chicken with a white gravy pasta with a red sauce chiliconcarne that is okay if you only visit the lounge once in your lifetime but for us who fly across the atlantic every month it is very monotonous,17th January 2018,London Heathrow Airport,4
Andrzej Bania,limited choice of food,warm welcome plenty of basic seating limited choice of food they claim 340 seats  but there is 1 unisex shower and you need to ask for a towel these are locked away in a separate cupboard it’s a weak lounge compared to galleries at t5 it’s not as nice as berlin it’s aweful compared to cathay pacific in paris etc it is miles better than hannover on the plus side  at least it’s airside,17th January 2018,Dusseldorf Airport,4
Andrzej Bania,experience was really good,modern clean and well attended limited array of food and drink options but everything was fresh and on point they cater for children and vegetarians and the whole experience was really good no where in the lounge where you can lay flat and limited seating for a major international  gives it a crowded feeling’ multiple individual showers with a ‘cupboard of useful stuff’  including razors combs etc  perfect if you’re travelling light it comes behind the galleries way behind cathay pacific paris etc  but trounces any german lounge,17th January 2018,San Francisco Airport,6
M Dorlan,lounge is much too small,the lounge is much too small and the food selection is lacking in variety the staff is rather dismissive in theeir attitude drinks were available with a wide selection there is a second lounge across the hall where you have the option to dine before boarding  it is much larger as well as is accommodates business class passengers as well i did not sample the food so i cant say anything about the selection or quality of the food available,7th January 2018,Chicago O'Hare Airport,6
D Mardessen,i am out and will drop ba for good,okay lounge with edible food can be a bit too busy at times they allow one guest only which i just found out applies to your children as well as i have more than one child i could not use the lounge or had to leave my 8 year old outside so much for missing my family while travelling for work when ba does not allow me to share the achieved benefits with them ba frequent flyer programme was already pretty useless  now i am out and will drop ba for good,1st January 2018,London Heathrow Airport,3
A Wharton,smaller and much quieter lounge,after the hustle and bustle of the north and south lounges in heathrow terminal 5a the smaller and much quieter lounge in b satellite is much appreciated it offers a full range of drinks and a reasonable food selection you can sit a down a chill without people rushing in and dashing out for a short haul a gate departure the interior is slightly dated but it is clean and the staff are helpful finding it is quite easy too unlike some of the ba lounges in european airports,22nd December 2017,London Heathrow Airport,7
A Wharton,former communist atmosphere,once you are past sofia airport security and in the terminal you turn left and go down some stairs into lounge overlooking the flight line entry is either frequent flyer status or pay to enter the staff are helpful and the lounge is clean food selection is very limited to some pastries and snacks drinks selection are a bar self pour draft beer  wines and spirits along with bottled water plenty of sofas and chairs & tables to work from it has a former communist atmosphere to it with the choice of colours and decorations,22nd December 2017,Sofia Airport,4
K Nevins,overcrowded with people and luggage,lounge small barely enough seating towards boarding time it was overcrowded with people and luggage basic drinks offer food was sub standard two small trays of sandwiches were brought and were almost inedible and ran out within minutes exactly same when i was there two years ago i thought it was a problem that particular day but i now realise two years on it’s the norm and british airways think that this is acceptable it’s comes to something when the inflight food and service is 100% better than that on the ground,22nd November 2017,Tampa Airport,1
Richard Clarke,not a comfortable stay at this lounge,monday morning this lhr north lounge t5 lounge was crowded and hardly a seat to be found seating was comfortable a food available was tasty although queues long good selection of drinks papers avaible but its hardly a lounge more like a morning cafe at rush hour as you couldnt truly relax toilets again are overwhelmed with passengers and i had to wait closecto 10 minutes just to use one cubicle as this was all they have couldnt see any showers to freshen up and they need to learn from the hong kong or changi experience not a nice experience for passengers these days as its no longer a lounge especially monday mornings a distinct lack of staff and the ones on duty were very disinterested in there job inside the lounge and hardly friendly  took an age to clean a table or remove used cups glasses plates passengers were seen removing plates so they could sit down and use there space for there plates etc hardly what you pay the extra for when ones flies business class wifi had a stable connection which was a kind of saving grace but its not a comfortable stay at this lounge,17th November 2017,London Heathrow Airport,4
Jason Law,a slightly better business lounge,the old first lounge at gatwick was terrible but ba have redeemed themselves with the new one which has a great view across the airfield food and drink remains the same as other 1st lounges  hotcold buffet selfservice beerwine incl champagnespirits in terms of competitors its a slightly better business lounge rather than a genuine 1st class one,14th November 2017,London Gatwick Airport,8
Jason Law,getting worse and worse,the first lounge at t5 is getting worse and worse the seating is now badly in need of some reupholstery with it looking cracked and worn in places the choice of champagne has declined; it used to be bollinger and now its a house ive never heard of the choice of magazines has been gutted with all the readable stuff from yesteryear the week economist spectator replaced with glossy fashionhighart wibble the food is ok but they no longer leave the lounge menus out im not even sure you can still order menu food and whilst its a bit of a firstworld whinge to complain about it  theyve not had drambuie in the lounge all year which means no more preflight rusty nails much like the rest of bas proposition  a bit tired off the pace and downmarket,14th November 2017,London Heathrow Airport,6
J Wadarthe,ba will offer the bare minimum,ba lounges at heathrow terminal 5 and edinburgh airport not having flown ba business class for a decade and having visited lounges in asia and the middle east airports i was ready to compare unfortunately several flights to edinburgh that day were delayed which meant the lounge was packed and noisy there was no chance of finding a quiet area to relax at first glance i noticed several drinks displays from loads of water and soft drinks to a large selection of wines and premium spirits several magazine racks were scatted throughout and a small computer station but it was the food that was the biggest disappointment just two small counters with a few salads tasteless pastas boiled rice some concoction with mince and tiny pieces of chicken drowned in sauce i ate only because i was hungry and had to spend nearly three hours until my flight left ok so it was busy and crowded but there was no extra attempt by the staff to clear tables and clean up i felt like i was in a canteen to be fair if the lounge was not so busy and one spent under an hour it would be passable but it showed how far the once worlds favourite airline has sunk so low in quality and customer care on my return the ba club lounge at edinburgh was much better spacious clean and comfortable seating with areas of privacy the view was uninspiring overlooking the car park it was a morning flight and again the food area was simply pathetic just a few pastries and cereals  nothing to really appetize you with it seems ba will offer the bare minimum and nothing more,13th November 2017,London Heathrow Airport,3
Michael Edwards,this is an okay lounge,the concorde room at terminal 7 in jfk airport is just a few metres past the fasttrack security lane and very convenient staff at the reception counter were quite curt and unfriendly whilst in contrast the waiting and serving staff inside the lounge were most hospitable and friendly the lounge was clean and comfortable a good choice of uk newspapers but very poor magazine choices there is an a la carte menu for lounge dining i chose a soup and dessert to enable maximum sleep time on the flight  both dishes were too a good standard this is an okay lounge but underlines the fact hat ba no longer try to offer a proper level of luxury to first class fares paying customers  many business class lounges are better than bas first class,31st October 2017,New York JFK Airport,6
Simon Fowler,an interesting selection of food,this express lounge is a new lounge which has just opened next to gate 8 in terminal 1 the gate used for flights to europe although available to all passengers on payment of $4995 it is primarily meant for business class customers on ba and norwegian the lounge is small and so can get full very quickly there was an interesting selection of food and a wide range of alcoholic beverages including some unusual craft beers the staff was wellorganised and helpful,26th October 2017,Oakland Airport,8
S Porter,would not pay to use this lounge,very poor lounge at malaga airport open to many airlines premium class passengers plus others who pay to use drinks okay but food very limited and not appetising poor sandwiches disappeared in a jiffy and not enough to go around the chicken one i had was pretty nondescript seating comfortable but if you are looking for food & drink and comfort before your flight then only the latter is any good plenty of sockets to charge your laptop etc i certainly would not pay to use this lounge,18th October 2017,Malaga Airport,3
Andrzej Bania,plenty of seating options,the galleries south lounge has lots of space plenty of seating options great coffeesnacks and a well stocked bar compared to the best lounges in germany that ba has to offer berlin  this is an absolute joy  in the business working areas it would be nice to have 24a usb charge points,29th September 2017,London Heathrow Airport,9
Zdenek Holy,most unpleasant experience ever,this was the singularly most unpleasant experience ever my wife and i were traveling first class on ba to london uk and were hoping to relax before the flight the food was mostly inedible the bathrooms were filthy the personnel rude and inattentive it appears that ba really does not give a damn about this facility,22nd July 2017,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,1
Guy Senior,definitely need improving,a most extraordinary third party lounge that british airways use at this airport the aircraft pier at basel is y shaped with the lounge on top of the junction of the y it is a huge 3 story circular structure with great views and unusually large smokingviewing terraces although only the middle story was open when i visited there was plenty of room drink options were ok but food was very limited to a few sandwiches and snacks this definitely need improving as otherwise it could be an excellent lounge,29th April 2017,Basel Mulhouse Airport,7
A Robertson,lukewarm food and awful presentation,ashamed that this is our national carrier this is supposed to be a first class lounge with torn seats lukewarm food and awful presentation all waiting staff stayed behind the doors whilst people stared at empty trays and a few staff who cared trying to help  management clearly at below stupid criteria was keen to fly ba because have managed more than few miles across long haul carriers from uk to middle east and asia pacific in business and first class and genuinely felt about time i tried,24th April 2017,London Heathrow Airport,3
M Shaw,staff in the lounge very attentive,ba lounge at south terminal gatwick airport good selection of snacks and beverages nice ambiance in the lounge and good facilities nice welcome by the receptionist staff in the lounge very attentive clearing tables quickly good selection of reading materials seating comfortable and not over crowded nice peaceful start to the start of our trip,21st April 2017,London Gatwick Airport,8
M Shaw,worst airline lounge visited,this has probably got to be the worst airline lounge i have ever visited the lady receptionist appeared miserable and not welcoming one tiny little bit there was a very poor selection of beverages and even less selection of snacks a bag of crisps or pizza flavoured very hard savoury biscuits seating was very comfortable toilet facilities not up to scratch no hand towels or air hand dryers in the toilet,21st April 2017,Pisa Airport,2
Guy Senior,plenty of comfortable seating,first impressions of the new lounge in the south terminal are not good as access is via a maze of corridors and a lift when you get there the lounge is a freestanding 2 storey structure on the roof of the main departure lounge this means floor to ceiling windows and good views the ground floor has some coffee stations a bar with a wide variety of drinks and hot food breakfast things when i arrived at 11am stew pasta and salad when i left an hour later on the mezzanine there was another coffee bar there was plenty of comfortable seating the mezzanine was a lot quieter so perhaps the place to sit at busy times the lift then took me straight down to within yards of my departure gate,7th April 2017,London Gatwick Airport,8
R Hughes,astonishingly good lounge,astonishingly good lounge opened 15th march with freshly cooked food and chef bar drinks etc bright airy on 4th floor and plenty of space for work etc  concorde lounge quality available to silver up  would definitely recommend,26th March 2017,Boston Logan Airport,9
J Aberg,food and drinks of low quality,new lounge at copenhagen airport located close to the departure lounge nice ambience as you walk into the lounge but it is downhill from there food and drinks are cheap and of low quality virtually no english magazines although a good selection of english newspapers what is really hilarious is the ba banner as you walk into the lounge telling you about the upgraded lounge experience,21st March 2017,Copenhagen Airport,3
Antony Meijer,i will not be returning,the aspire lounge at zurich airport is handy when you are a lone business traveller but for families or even couples it is simply not up to par it is far too small with almost non existent service food and beverages are not sufficient i will not be returning to this lounge,7th March 2017,Zurich Airport,3
E Smyth,lounge is fully operational,ba new lounge at lgw in spite of reported teething problems the lounge is fully operational clean well staffed and well laid out reasonable selection of breakfast food offerings in line with lhr offering good airport views from large windows there is a small but well equipped childrens play area which was quite at the time of review there is a good selection of magazines and news papers a positive experience and well worth the wait,26th February 2017,London Gatwick Airport,10
Catalin-Alexandru Epure,persons at reception are friendly,british airways has its own lounge at tegelairport which accomodates all oneworld peers and given the size of the airport the lounge is pretty spacious they seem to have used the space very efficently it is placed before security this means less time to spend there then usual and the toilets are located 2 floors beneath so you have to take the elevator to get there there are public restrooms they dont belong to the lounge but it is really not the fault of british airways for this i would rather say the airport infrastructure made it like this the persons at the reception are friendly and it is a pleasure to see them all the time smiling and ready to help you the drinks are plentiful it is not the case when it comes to food: they only have their signature sandwiches which are good and come in 4 or 5 varieties the problem is that there is nothing more and they used to have some crisps now they were replaced by peanuts and to be onest i really miss those crisps considering that they only have a few flights from tegel it is nice of ba to have a lounge there and it is a good opportunity to spend the time before your flight,23rd February 2017,Berlin Tegel Airport,7
Catalin-Alexandru Epure,wasn't a real first class lounge,as i read some reviews online looks like this lounge was made by british airways to accomodate the othere oneworld peers with status emerald and not use their own concorde lounge after reading about it i wasnt expecting much and i could realise it wasnt a real first class lounge it had some elements but i have seen better ones i should start with the fact that it was crowded yet not full you could find a seat about the food there was a buffet with not so many things and the a la carte menu wasnt present i had to ask an waiter about it then i ordered the famous british airways burger which wasnt great something was missing the desserts were better whith a lot of choices cakes and fruits and good quality the drinks as in every lounge are plentfull and always there when you need them in the desription there is a spaarea which i couldnt find the toilets were very modern and very clean a good place for spending the time between flights nothing more,23rd February 2017,London Heathrow Airport,6
Michael Davies,i've been in better,it was very quiet when i visited at 10am on a weekday im always happy to be able to use a lounge when travelling  but ive been in better there is no view over the airport the lounge has windows but you can only see the adjacent building good choice of drinks the food choice was not very good a few pastries some ham and cheese and sliced bread there are no flight information screens in this lounge but they will announce your flight reasonably well located  only a short walk from the gates,22nd February 2017,Rome Fiumicino Airport,7
A Wong,american airlines lounge is better,as my flight from hong kong arrives at 4:30am and no hotel will check you in the ba arrivals lounge is really useful i did expect this lounge to be very good at the new t5 not so it is not bad but the american airlines lounge at t3 after renovation is better and serves better food but as i said it is useful as you are not driven out to wander in the london street in winter time,7th February 2017,London Heathrow Airport,8
Andrzej Bania,give the concorde room a rethink,when i was invited by a friend to meet in the concorde room my expectation levels were high unfortunately while it is nice  it falls short of bas billing in too many ways far too much space has been allocated to the lounging area which meant that the individual dining tables were cramped the food was ok and the initial service was fast enough but the empty plates and glasses stay on the table far too long  over half an hour in our case the lounge area is richly decorated  which makes the hospital style restrooms a bit of a shock  complete with chipped doorswalls and tired styling overall its okay but if you judged the heathrow terminal 5 concorde room as a hotel youd struggle to award it 5 stars terminal 5 is great but ba needs to give the concorde room a rethink,28th January 2017,London Heathrow Airport,8
M Parry,there was no real service,very disappointed by the initial appearance of this british airways terminal 3 first class lounge at london heathrow first impressions count for a lot but subsequent ones were not much better admittedly we had previously been spoiled by the ba lhr t5 concorde room lounge the welcome was insincere the lighting was dingy and there was no real service unless you ate in the so called restaurant part glasses and trash were not picked up in a timely manner tables were not wiped this lounge was definitely the poor relation of the t5 lounges i only wish they would have similar standards across their 2 terminals given the choice i would rather not go from t3 unless i was flying virgin atlantic,26th January 2017,London Heathrow Airport,4
Alice Boyd,friendly and helpful staff,excellent friendly and helpful staff well stocked with drinks cheese fruit biscuits snacks kept tidy in the lounge more care could have taken with maintaining cleanliness in the toilets  although i may just have been unlucky in my timing since i did see a cleaner going in 10 minutes later good electrics hookups for all plug variants kept both me and my daughter and our technologies happy,14th January 2017,Houston IAH,8
Daniel Strassberg,the lounge is a good size,british airways has its own lounge in singapore the lounge is a good size with plenty of seating and power points staff are okay not particularly friendly and did not provide any announcements about the delay in boarding gate closed at 19:35 and by 19:30 people began to question if they had missed the boarding call had to ask as did many others what was happening only to be told there was a 20 minute delay snacks and meals put out where the exact same in november as is december which thankfully was not too bad wifi was good and lots of power points to charge devices bathroom and showers are good,7th December 2016,Singapore Changi Airport,8
Guy Senior,it lacks any pizazz,this heathrow terminal 3 lounge has most that you might require  a restaurant a spa champagne bar food and particularly good table wine there is also lots of space however it lacks any pizaz or sparkle and is definitely not the concorde room it can also be a long walk from the gates but the design of t3 makes this unavoidable,24th November 2016,London Heathrow Airport,8
Derrick Clarke,space was limited,common lounge for first and business class passengers meant space was limited due to inefficient queues through security and passport control we only had around half an hour in the lounge with the limited seating and food options and quality it was long enough think lukewarm curry and soggy pastries,22nd November 2016,Johannesburg Airport,5
Ann Gibbs,stop treating us like cattle,my husband and i were looking forward to relaxing in this british airways lounge at gatwick airport before our flight to cyprus we were expecting space choice of food and drinks how disappointed we were when we walked into a packed lounge with long queues to get an alcoholic drink with hot food and nowhere to sit the only buffet type food included flapjacks nuts fruit stale brownies lemon drizzle cake tea and coffee i would expect cold meats sandwiches salads bread rolls cheese & biscuits etc it was not at all clear on arrival what queue was for what no menus to be seen and no one to ask what a waste of time and money to think this was a lounge with luxury in mind we would have rather paid for a decent breakfast in one of the main restaurants it has put us off booking club class again there was only one toilet outside the lounge come on british airways do not take your passengers for granted and stop treating us like cattle,21st November 2016,London Gatwick Airport,2
J Lemon,experienced excellent service,as we were flying in ba first from london to washington we were invited to use the concorde lounge we experienced excellent service which included complimentary eggs benedict for breakfast and superb champagne i believe the latter was laurentperrier grand siecle this is the best lounge ive had the opportunity to visit however some of the furniture is in need of refurbishment and i was surprised to see worn torn stained and chipped items here and there in a lounge of this caliber,17th November 2016,London Heathrow Airport,9
T Lukesh,like a 7-11 convenience store,terrible food staledry bread on the sandwiches dry cheeses tasteless soup veges ok but for a first class lounge it really needs to step up to other airlines feels like a 711 convenience store is giving free samples terrible drink selection is good good variety,14th November 2016,San Francisco Airport,1
Clive Drake,ghastly. uncomfortable,i am writing this review from the british airways dubai first class lounge as we have a 2 hour delay on the flight this is the new lounge and i agree its new as i passed though dubai 14 months ago i am not sure its an improvement on the old one at least you could look at planes taxing by and to be honest  its a complete joke passengers pass through the club world lounge and are given oddly a pass to scan  to gain access to the all new concorde lounge if you ask me whats the difference  id say you tell me its a room about six meters square in the center it has a marble top island to seat eight with power sockets the seats are high stools and very uncomfortable it has two alcoves which seats 2 persons a apiece thats fine if you had something decent to eat one wall has a couple of chillers and there is plenty of booze  including some fizz food well there is a hot plate and when we asked the floor attendant for some hot food  he said we dont offer it i said when do you he said never on offer was some hummus sliced carrots olives stuffed vine leaves pickled beans sun blushed tomatoes mixed salad sickly cakes which nobody touched nuts soup  that came from the club lounge bread and some fruit a coffee machine thats it folks eight winged chairs same as the club option sit around the room  four facing the white out window and the shopping mall and duty free ghastly uncomfortable there is no separate toilets to business class given the emirates competition and qantas on this route logic would tell you well with ba logic is not on their vocabulary  you would think they would want to beat them on quality style and presentation three flights a day  with a potential for 40 or so 1st customers  you would think ba would want to stand out they do  but for all the wrong reasons,9th November 2016,Dubai Airport,2
Craig Beck,food is very poor,pretty basic swissport lounge at larnaca airport food is very poor a few dried up sandwiches and tiny squares of pizza and thats about it not enough power points to go around and the screaming kids does nothing to help one work there is nothing luxury about this cafe at lca,8th November 2016,Larnaca Airport,3
Patrick Suess,it was incredibly full,this lounge reminded me more of a good business lounge than a first class lounge in peak time it was incredibly full and guests in there did not really know how to behave i cant usually stand it when somebody puts his feet on a table in a public area or is nearly shouting via the phone staff was overloaded with work so the lounge was not the cleanest it is quite nice that you can have champagne in there and that there is some food that can be ordered nonetheless the real first class lounge is probably the concorde room,27th October 2016,London Heathrow Airport,8
D Vansen,a very poor lounge,a very poor british airways lounge at boston logan airport with uncomfortable seating very close together and very few power outlets hot and airless with no windows and toilet facilities for men consisting of one toilet and one urinal stall there is a full restaurant which i did not use small selection of food and drink,18th October 2016,Boston Logan Airport,3
Penelope Knollys,have been in better lounges,this lounge at gatwick airport is quite a nice place and we spent a long time there because our flight was terribly delayed i was looking forward to a glass of prosecco but  they had run out  and a glass of champagne was £8 we did not have any food as we were expecting to eat on the plane when it eventually departed there werent many free seats in this lounge because of the delay and the most comfortable ones had already been taken noone seemed to know how to get wifi in the lounge but luckily someone in the reception area was able to help us we found this pretty surprising and noone knew the right password to get into wifi we did eventually get it it was ok but not great and we have been in better lounges for business travel in other countries in the world which are not nearly as civilised as london,10th October 2016,London Gatwick Airport,6
R Tilling,tired old lounge a disappointment,this tired old british airways lounge in heathrow t3 is a disappointment other airlines are upping their game with lounge quality and ba is just resting on its laurels the food selection in the evening is more like a school canteen than a business class lounge there was a chicken casserole lukewarm jacket potatoes grated cheese along with several empty catering vats that appeared to have once contained a pasta dish and baked beans twenty minutes later they were still empty the drink selection was good champagne was available but only on request and finding a member of staff is quite hard when i did they grudgingly headed off to wherever the bottle was locked away most tables were cluttered with dirty plates glasses dishes and rubbish dishes and plates don’t clean themselves there are not enough toilets to cope with the volume of passengers either standards are embarrassingly bad in the end i left and went to the american airlines lounge in terminal 3 for some food,8th October 2016,London Heathrow Airport,3
B Brandt,air france better than british airways,british airways lounge at johannesburg airport had a good selection of food and beverage temperature was fine there are not enough charge stations and some seats were uncomfortable lounge gets very crowded bathroom and showers are not as luxurious as other airline lounges i dont think i would use british airways business class again we used air france business class in 2015 and i thought the seating and lounges were much better than british airways,13th September 2016,Johannesburg Airport,7
R Owen-Browne,lounge at phoenix not fit for purpose,the first and business class lounge at phoenix airport is not fit for purpose there is nothing more i can add its small outdated and a real disappointment it doesnt even have washrooms let alone a shower it is a serious disappointment and similar to the 747 which we travelled in if somebody senior at ba travelled with etihad emirates or many other airlines they would realize very quickly that they are way behind,29th August 2016,Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport,1
A Wong,b gate lounge was not congested,british airways has three lounges at heathrow two are at a gate north and south both are always congested but it is the b lounge that i used this time even i fly from a gate and it was excellent b gate lounge are mainly used by long haul passengers and while the food service is the same it was not congested thus this time when i arrived early i used it even knowing that my flight would depart on a a gate,16th August 2016,London Heathrow Airport,9
Richard Callis,like the terrace in this lounge,this is an excellent lounge the dining room has a nice meal available with waiter service on this occasion steak and chips with a tasty sauce beautifully cooked with excellent presentation and great service i like the terrace in this lounge a nice place to relax the inside room is much better than the first class lounge not really but the ba first class lounge is a great place to be the strict limitations on entry mean the concorde room is never that busy,31st July 2016,London Heathrow Airport,10
Keith Taylor,this is no premium service,not impressed had to wait for plates and wine to be opened by harassed looking staff who could only be apologetic  and frankly school meals are better than the dross that was on offer then to be confronted by queues on the way out only reinforced the feeling that this is no premium service better save your money and use some of the excellent independent restaurants at heathrow,23rd July 2016,London Heathrow Airport,5
Steven Vanduffel,really needs a refresh,this athens airport british airways lounge is a small lounge space for about 50 people furniture is more than 20 years old and really needs a refresh i found it rather warm inside a small selection of sandwiches and salads all in all i found it ok but nothing more than that  no need to go earlier to the airport to enjoy the lounge,19th July 2016,Athens Airport,6
Andrew Hickling,plenty of chairs and sofas,this concorde room lounge is the best of the ba lounges in t5 if you book a flight in advance book a private cabana in the lounge for a maximum of four hours where you can sleep shower watch tv make free phone calls and have room service there is a dining room for breakfast lunch and dinner with food and wine menus dotted around the lounge there is also a boardroom for internet and printer use where the chairs are from concorde the bar is well stocked with premium drinks and a manned area for your luggage there are plenty of chairs and sofas to relax in although some of the furnishings are beginning to look a little tired it is a great place to start a holiday or business trip and its never that crowded when ive visited,17th July 2016,London Heathrow Airport,9
Andrew Hickling,"large, comfortable and clean lounge",this is the first time i had used the galleries lounge at jfk which is also shared with qantas and ana passengers as part of the one world alliance it is good to note though that only ba club world passengers are allowed to use the elemis spa and the preflight supper facility otherwise it would be impossible to receive any of these services it is a large comfortable and clean lounge with showers pcs a bar and snacks a great place to relax before a long flight,16th July 2016,New York JFK Airport,9
Patrick Ferrall,overcrowded with very few seats available,club europe is the best option lhr to gva and the business class lounge my only option was overcrowded mainly families with small kids  who mostly sat in economy with very few seats available when i did find a seat i went to get a pre flight snack and was mostly confronted by jacket potatoes and baked beans i left the lounge and relaxed in one of the airport bar restaurants that was much more relaxing and provided better options and service,16th July 2016,London Heathrow Airport,1
Tim Buffery,lounge was closed,booked a surprise anniversary holiday to rome for my wife flying ba club class direct with ba in june 2015 wanted something very special which included lounge services outward journey from gatwick was great hotel was great arrived at rome airport to find lounge was closed due to fire back in may 2015 and very limited eating facilities were available and all were full no gate allocated due to delays hence no seat a bad experience waiting over 3 hours with coffee and pastry which ba did not provide wrote emailed and called ba and response was very slow incoming they confirmed that an email advising that the lounge was unavailable was sent to me true this was posted out the last night before we left which i didnt retrieve until i got home ba knew in june 2015 the lounge was shut due to a fire the previous month however they didnt bother to tell me at time i booked holiday no apology has very been forthcoming,10th July 2016,Rome Fiumicino Airport,1
D Houlihan,ba need to up their game,after using the pretty abysmal lounge british airways had in terminal one and the new move to the new d gates in dubai i was expecting an upgraded first lounge no staff to serve good wines and coffee if one is flying first from dubai consider the competition of emirates first ba need to up their game big time,3rd July 2016,Dubai Airport,4
Rob Liddiard,3rd rate buffet fare,i have not visited a british airways lounge for a few years the one i visited recently was completely inferior from the last one i visited especially in the food and beverage area this time 3rd rate buffet fare stale rolls and a wine selection from a cheap supermarket the seating was reasonably comfortable but seriously in need of a makeover in summary a 25 experience whereas the likes of emirates and qatar at heathrow would be close to 55,4th June 2016,London Heathrow Airport,2
Nigel Diepering,spacious and comfortable,this lounge is used by ba as its business class lounge and for its frequent fliers it is also available to rand merchant private bank customers the lounge is spacious and comfortable with good views of the runway and aircraft parking bays staff are friendly wifi is good and free food and drinks offering is excellent and constantly replenished,28th May 2016,Cape Town Airport,9
L Aritonang,"washrooms messy, dirty and smelly",the british airways lounge at heathrow terminal 5 was really crowded during my visit this time and staff seemed overwhelmed there were a lot of dirty plates and glasses all over the place the washrooms were probably the worst bit they were messy dirty and smelly the airport toilet were actually much better the selection of food and drinks were nothing to shout about in fact the light meal menu choices pasta curry etc have been unchanged for the last several years overall this is not the worst business lounge i have ever been but dont expect the same quality offered by the premier airlines,13th May 2016,London Heathrow Airport,3
Heidi Spencer,worst lounge i have been in,british airways lounge at munich airport probably the worst lounge i have been in hard to find and it was filthy the seats were so gross you did not even want to sit on them really unbelievable for an airline with a reputation for quality,5th May 2016,Munich Airport,1
Craig Stembridge,very well planned lounge,the slow lounge is a very well planned domestic lounge with excellent service from the moment you walk in staffing is first class and attentive the variety on offer and the total cleanliness of the lounge all others within the domestic terminal,16th April 2016,Johannesburg Airport,8
Albert Wong,the food is limited,british airways has several lounges at heathrow terminal 5 that are airy and spacious but unfortunately it is always congested at gate a area  the food is limited and always the same in more than a year as i used it often the internet is not working properly most time and difficult to make a print out however i discovered that the lounge at b gate is much much better it is never congested and far more comfortably in terms of space ratio the trouble is that ba dies not announce whether flight is from a or b and you normally go to a,16th April 2016,London Heathrow Airport,7
Jennifer Holford,ba lounge until january 2017,british airways club class passengers are being directed to this lounge while the ba business lounge is being refurbished for use by virgin according to ba staff at the front desk no 1 will be the default ba lounge until january 2017 when british airways will move operations to the south terminal definitely something to bear in mind when choosing a carrier for your next flight as no1 is a very poor substitute for the old north terminal business lounge the lounge is open access and was very crowded when we used it at around midday on 1st april a staff member took the trouble to find us seating when we complained because of the crowding the lounge is very noisy self service provision of food was very limited unattractive and was not renewed quickly enough washrooms: there are 3 cubicles in the womens toilets so inevitable queueing although the area was clean and well fitted no showers are available poor selection of newspapers and magazines,15th April 2016,London Gatwick Airport,4
Mark McCullough,a small selection of beverages,british airways website claims this lounge at amsterdam schiphol recently refurbished reflects the style and elegance of the galleries lounges at lhr t5 i disagree they also claim it has a deli area for light dining and a stylish bar the former offers soup plastic cheese and crisps the latter is no more than a counter with a small selection of beverages no champagne or sparkling wine no sofas or anything you could recline on if you were tired on the plus side it has a nice view of the airfield,7th April 2016,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,4
Sam Healey,poor overall quality and service,i can only concur with earlier reviews of this british airways heathrow t3 lounge regarding its poor overall quality and service i have been in more welcoming bus stations food offerings were scant and were also poorly presented without care and attention i do not expect haute cuisine at all having used ba lounges before but there were no dinner plates to place any food items on when i was there in the early afternoon the only food offerings were rolls salad jacket potatoes no butter and baked beans the only plates available were saucer sized maybe this is their way of persuading people to not eat too much and the drink can were half sized cost cutting is very much in evidence here and it also shows in the attitude of the staff who seemed really miserable tables took a long time to be cleared and some of the bins were overflowing this is not how a lounge should be at all i used the toilets and found these to be quite clean i did wonder why the toilet rolls were placed about 6 inches above the ground however; a clear design flaw ba should take a long and hard look at this lounge and make great strides in improving it giving the catering contract to a decent caterer or use marks and spencer to provide food would be a good start,5th April 2016,London Heathrow Airport,1
Helen Estlea,"inadequate, uncomfortable seating",this tiny british airways lounge at san francisco airport had inadequate uncomfortable seating and resembled a hospital waiting room there were nowhere near enough seats for the stream of passengers entering the poor selection of food that greeted us was a couple of empty platters with some disassembled sandwich remains which was only replenished after i asked and ran out again in minutes each time it was laid out the side plates kept running out too staff were present but seemed to lack energy and speed very disappointing given the equally poor temporary arrangements at gatwick when we flew out a lackluster beginning and end to our holiday and a disappointment in our flag carrier airline we will book with other airlines in future,3rd April 2016,San Francisco Airport,3
Hwei Ming Choo,lounge was very packed,was directed into the gatwick airport no 1 traveller lounge as bas lounge was under refurbishment overall the lounge was lovely staff very attentive and friendly service was prompt the downside is at times the lounge was very packed space to seat was hard to come by i saw some people actually waited for their flight in the library due lack of space in the usual sofa area,1st April 2016,London Gatwick Airport,7
B Wijesinghe,downgraded ambience of lounge,this is a brand new lounge that opened last month in the new concourse d at dxb while concourse d works reasonably well it is a long walk from this lounge to the gate as in the past i prefer the seating layout in their old lounge to this as all the seats here are arranged in long rows that face each other with only one corridor being a single row food has improved a bit in quality but the lounge feels more crowded and no longer offers any tarmac views the decor is somewhat similar to the lounge at washington dulles but that lounge has an exceptionally good layout and higher quality food compared to this one i am surprised that ba downgraded the ambience of this lounge when emirates has upgraded their lounges at dxb recently,1st April 2016,Dubai Airport,5
B Motto,what a disappointment,what a disappointment the new british airways first class lounge is at dubai airport i travelled from there today & the lounge is just not working for me or other first class passengers who were commenting on it too the lounge is a separate room from the rest of the new galleries lounge which has just opened in terminal d at dubai airport overall both lounges are much smaller than the old lounge & the views are internal through some form of frosted glass which you have to stand up to look out of the first class lounge seating is a joke not very comfortable & the food is well best left as the variety is very poor you have a access card given to you when you arrive at the lounge to let you into the first class area just so pretentious not really required & not wanted there are no comfortable armchairs or sofas to relax on just these boutique swivel chairs which are just very uncomfortable i do not know who designed this lounge but i am sure they have never flown before or used a lounge before they need to scrap the lot & start again as it is not working & no doubt cost a fortune to be designed by a clueless student if you are going to use the new first class lounge then set your expectations very low,1st April 2016,Dubai Airport,2
Ronald Miller,has very little to offer,this is a tiny lounge located in t5 at chicago ohare it is cramped and has very little to offer as far as food selections; however they will send you across the hall to dine preflight if so desired the receptionist is very nice and the selection of nibbles is not bad drinks are readily available the service staff is pleasant good view of the runways and flight movements,24th March 2016,Chicago O'Hare Airport,7
Ronald Miller,quite an enjoyable experience,after a bit of looking around i was able to locate the british airways arrivals lounge in t5 the reception staff was pleasant but not overly welcoming after presenting my boarding pass for my arriving flight i was given entrance to the waiter assisted restaurant instead if the buffet i had a full english breakfast while not overly generous in quantity was very good in quality aside from a screaming child quite an enjoyable experience,24th March 2016,London Heathrow Airport,10
K Ong,service really poor,i used the number 1 lounge in the gatwick north terminal a couple of weeks ago due to british airways refurbishing their normal lounge service really poor food poor atmosphere poor too it has consistently been overcrowded and there was no space at all  i was waiting for 10 min just looking for a place to sit,23rd March 2016,London Gatwick Airport,2
Jennifer Bentley,everything else is a disgrace,id read that british airways were using a third party lounge at rome airport since the fire last year so i was delighted to learn at check in that the ba lounge was open apart from the space everything else is a disgrace no flight screens food left out uncovered for 2+ hrs coffee machine not refilled crockery and cutlery not refilled when asked they said it was for security reasons dirty crockery left uncleared for 2 hrs appalling service,12th March 2016,Rome Fiumicino Airport,2
J Rose,absolutely dreadful experience,absolutely dreadful experience at this british airways lounge at chicago ohare airport inadequate in every respect and certainly not of first class quality small crowded cramped limited food choices disappointing if this is the best oneworld has to offer at ord dont waste too much time here if any,7th March 2016,Chicago O'Hare Airport,3
Stephen Yeates,loyalty to ba is diminishing,i am a british airways gold exec card holder though my loyalty to ba is diminishing as time goes by the lounge in lisbon is a shared lounge with the ability to purchase entry it is completely the opposite end of the terminal to passport control i have been using this lounge for over 3 years and have had cause to complain on numerous occasions the food selection has remained the same in all this while often dry sandwiches and a few pastries regardless of time of day i regularly have to ask for ice quite often to be told it is in the other lounge there are two separate lounges divided by the reception on one occasion there was no coffee available at 600 in the morning for the first flight this flight also means that the food service has not been stocked or cleaned from the previous day i have not once seen a ba staff member checking the establishment there are no spare electrical sockets for charging one must remove a lamp the toilets often smell and are often unclean despite complining to ba and being assured that the matter will be resolved it has not british airways i have a choice using emirates,22nd February 2016,Lisbon Airport,2
Jenny Bentley,lounge is truly dreadful,this lounge is truly dreadful : it does not even have washing or toilet facilities it has a few comfortable chairs an insufficient number coffee was lukewarm the departure displays were incorrect the wifi did not work thankfully we were travelling for leisure and not business as the place had lots of noisy children in it too,21st February 2016,Marrakech Airport,1
Jenny Bentley,more crowded than normal,british airways are currently refurbishing their gatwick lounge and relocating it to south terminal no 1 lounge was fine but it did mean that it was more crowded than normal however the choice of food and service was very good though it could do with a few more chairs in the quiet area,20th February 2016,London Gatwick Airport,8
Neil Oakshott,ba fast slipping down the league,the transfer of british airways lhrphoenix flight from t5 to t3 gave hope that with it would come a bright shiny business lounge alas that hasnt happened the impression you get is that the airline is trying to do more with less cramming as many people into a small space as they can and getting away with providing a few nondescript snacks to keep the masses fed the reality is that british airways has outdone even the tatty t5 lounges in stripping away any vestiges of comfort and it is a reason not to enjoy or should that be endure preflight relaxation in there dirty plates glasses cups and cutlery are left laying on surfaces for ages the carpet and upholstery is already grubby and stained and i swear there is more food on the carpets than on the servery as an airline ba is fast slipping down the league table and what was always considered a premier airline is now nothing more than an expensive middle of the road haulier they should invest in staff who at least hold the customer in more than thinlyveiled contempt as once you get past reception you are unlikely to see a smiling face ill still fly their lhrphx route each month but will avoid the lounge in future instead putting myself at the mercy of the general concourse its got to be better safer and more hygienic,12th February 2016,London Heathrow Airport,1
David Ellis,lounge is a shocker,its hard to imagine a worst lounge than this travesty at rio de janeiro terminal one getting to it involves a long trek past many closed airport concessions some of these may be undergoing refurbishment for the olympics but the general impression was of terminal decline everything about the lounge is shabby from the state of the carpet to the food and drink on offer its shared with other airlines so it becomes extremely busy when there are a number of late evening flights departing wine is limited to a single choice of red and white the food options are lamentable trying to find somewhere to plugin a laptop proved ridiculous as sockets were either not working or other passengers had unplugged extension leads to plug in their own equipment bizarrely there wasnt a single screen in the lounge displaying the status of departures meaning that one was totally reliant on the staff at reception who seemed uninterested in keeping passengers informed god help those using the lounge during the olympics the lounge is a shocker,11th February 2016,Rio De Janeiro Airport,1
Rafal Pilinski,staff s attentive and helpful,lounge offers showers and nice comfortable area to eat or relax good choice of soft drinks hot beverages and alcoholic drinks flight information screens in lounges at peak times the food areas take longer then expected to clean but lounge staff is attentive and helpful,7th February 2016,London Heathrow Airport,8
Andrew Rogers,lounge was quiet,excellent transfer from aircraft to the lounge the lounge was quiet with lots of room and welcoming from the entry point and the customer service desk very good selection of hot and cold beverages and alcohol and a very good selection of red and white wine the food available was very good for this time in the morning free wifi very clean shower and washroom facilities and very good views over the ru way and taxi ways,6th February 2016,London Heathrow Airport,10
A Rogers,welcoming and attentive,had access to the lounge due to business class ticket with iberia lounge was busy due to first flight rotation from glasgow found a seat very easily the lounge offering was good nice selection of breakfast items cereals pastries and hot beverages also a very good selection of alcohol and soft drinks staff were very welcoming and attentive,6th February 2016,Glasgow Airport,10
Diana Pincott,utilitarian experience,had used this british airways lounge in dubai four times in late 2015 its a 10minute walk from the departure gate c11 the room is small service was nonexistent food on offer was basic as the morning flight for heathrow departs shortly after 9 am i tend to skip breakfast at the hotel so would have welcomed something decent at the lounge there were cereals juice some unappetizing looking hot food bowls of fresh fruit salad some filled rolls cashew nuts and the ubiquitous crisps the offering made the little chef motorway cafes style look upmarket there were alcoholic drinks but didnt sample them so cannot comment on their quality even the toilets were basic: 2 cubicles in the female toilet be prepared to queue choice of english newspapers were limited to the daily mail and sometimes the times wifi was painfully slow all in all a functional and utilitarian experience,3rd February 2016,Dubai Airport,3
Diana Pincott,choice of food interesting,the warsaw airport lounge for oneworld frequent travellers was one floor below ground level and accessible via a lift it was very crowded on a saturday morning with hardly an empty seat 20 minutes before boarding time for london heathrow the choice of food was interesting  plenty of sweets including ferraro rocher the tub of crudities i picked looked fresh and tasted fresh  far better than the snack offered on board ba economy class there seemed to be a good choice of food and drink only one ladies toilet inside the lounge so queuing was inevitable midrange for a frequent traveller lounge,3rd February 2016,Warsaw Chopin Airport,6
Clive Drake,falls well short of the mark,i have been to this lounge on many occasions and would describe it as okay its discreet and private décor is fine but looking a little dated well spaced out and private allocation of seats i like this lounge up to a point the food choice is very basic nothing to get to excited about drinks are fine but the champagne is mid priced and not very inspired   staff are fine its all part of the first package and compared with airlines such as singapore airlines we were on the way to singapore it falls well short of the mark in what i feel the overall first class experience should be shame really with a bit of effort from ba it could be fantastic,31st January 2016,London Heathrow Airport,8
Jennifer Graystone,not many seats to be found,when we entered the lounge the receptionist checked our flight and advised us to check the screens for advice the lounge was pretty busy with not many seats to be found but we found one eventually and had a drink our flight was delayed and we kept checking the board but no gate available all other flights were showing their gates etc we eventually got bored of waiting and left the lounge only to find that our flight was closing and there must have been a fault in the lounge with the display we had to run through the airport and when we arrived they told us the flight was closed and that our bags were being offloaded i think they took pity on us however as they allowed us to board but weve never seen our suitcase since,18th January 2016,London Heathrow Airport,4
E Thomson,serious issues with staff,after the welcome at the door it goes downhill rapidly this british airways lounge rates poorly against other airline lounges used on this trip it is shabby seats stained fairly untidy floor in less than pristine condition went to the ladies restroom to freshen up and as soon as entering staff member pointed a finger at an open door and said that one i helped the man who came to clear the debris previously left on the table we had to use by moving cups etc across the wide table saying that might help only to be met with stony silence british airways have some serious issues with unenthusiastic uncommunicative staff to add to their other problems  maybe they arent appreciated after the difficulty and time it took for ba to accept that our full business tickets booked via another airline involving three legs on different airlines inc ba entitled us to entry to their lounge a matter which will be taken further with ba we only had time for a quick freshen and a glass of water before our gate opened for our next ba experience,5th January 2016,London Heathrow Airport,4
Karly Smith,lounge not recommended,terminal 5 heathrow south lounge very tired furniture staff standing around talking whilst rubbish remained uncleared from bar fly in orange juice jug not removed childrens area playstations not working plugged in ipad to charge at a designated powerpoint and a lounge staff member went past and turned off the powerpoint despite being told the ipad was mine and it was there to charge very little food apart from chips and snacks saw a fellow passenger charging his phone from from a powerpoint under a carpet tile as unable to find any working powerpoints near seating very disappointing lounge is not recommended,31st December 2015,London Heathrow Airport,3
Mark Shenton,worst possible lounge,this is the worst possible lounge ive ever been in it is tired stained and to be honest i thought i would catch something the food is cold andor stale the staff didnt really care  oh and to top it off the wifi doesnt work as a plus the toilet the toilet isnt even in the lounge we used the lounge when travelling with qatar airways,23rd December 2015,Munich Airport,1
E Davis Bennett,galleries lounge - london heathrow airport,i found the british airways lounge at london heathrow disappointing i find jfk galleries to be better the magazine selection was sparse and the food choices were fine but not the ability to sit in a separate dining area with hot food as in jfk i was flying from prague and the allocated time to get from one terminal to another at heathrow was so lengthy even through the fast lanes  that myself and other travelers barely had time to grab a bite to eat and run and board it was poor planning of connecting flights and other americans flying ba from prague via heathrow to jfk said the same thing no tea sandwiches or other choices  the time of arrival is when it seems to be very basic in snacks food for a meal and no tea sandwiches and too early for wine  dishes were left to be picked up and the host of the lounge when i arrived was lacking in skills of courteous service i could have been in a food court sadly i do not understand why it appears that british airways do not care as much anymore  which is sad because i have always been a loyalist,12th December 2015,London Heathrow Airport,2
A Zanier,a good impression,i visited one of the lounges at t5 and diversified acoording to your frequent flyer tierstatus a good impression for the gallery lounge for club europe travellers in t5 south: plenty of seats different views of the outside full range of soft drinks and alcoholic ones as well light meals soups sandwiches cakes are also provided but i did not taste them toilets ok overall cleanliness of common spaces can nevertheless be improved,12th December 2015,London Heathrow Airport,7
P Beet,lounge is very comfortable,used this lounge for the first time before a flight to singapore this lounge is very comfortable with subdued decoration it was not crowded and with excellent service we used the restaurant and had an very good light meal we also wondered over to the first class lounge we have used before and this was very different in character it was large and more crowded with buffet food so we went back to the concorde lounge and asked reception why they had two lounges and she explained that ours was for exclusive use of first class passengers whilst the first class lounge was in reality just a frequent flyer facility confusing or what nothing too flash about the concorde room just a relaxing place to prepare for you flight,26th November 2015,London Heathrow Airport,10
Assis Pontes,ideal place to recharge,shower facilities top notch good selection of snacks and food the lounge is spacious and offers various zones for sitting used the lounge before the peak hour though staffed by one person only the staff person was very capable decor and atmosphere are great an ideal place to recharge before next flight,21st November 2015,Washington Dulles Airport,8
Cammy King,worse than the old one,i think the new lounge is actually worse than the old one except its nearer to gates the bar is dreadful  beer selection is awful  no domestic brandsbottles at all plus you need to ask for anything its not self service  that includes all drinks a bit like detention with the principal watching bar staff miserable  perhaps not treated very well i suspect qantas sponsored lounge i actually left and got a beer id heard of and liked across the corridor outside  sad to have to do  a few other passengers had previously mentioned this to us but said you need to see it copy t5s example food ok at least there was hot food with butter chicken although not chicken breast no other hot meat dishes,16th November 2015,Los Angeles LAX Airport,3
David Ellis,a huge improvement,the new british airways businessfirst lounge at cape town is a huge improvement on the cramped lounge that used to be shared with virgin atlantic although theres plenty of space the seats got used up once passengers from two flights had arrived catering is a little limited and included two hot options and various deli offerings including packaged cheese portions drink flowed freely and included champagne staff were efficient at clearing away,15th November 2015,Cape Town Airport,8
Cammy King,absolutely shocking,we arrived mid morning on a saturday hungry and looking forward to some hot and cold selections that we have come to regularly enjoy at ba lounges who we choose to sleep on and skip breakfast on the flight thats where it ends a total disgrac  no food at all never mind hot selections all breakfasts are cleared apparently by 930am with no eggs bacon sausages etc available  even on request the place was packed as expected and we were not alone in this feeling we are terribly disappointed toast stodgy porridge or croissants thats your lot until midday  when we had to leave to get connecting flight absolutely shocking after what we paid,15th November 2015,London Heathrow Airport,2
Nicholas Ware,a ghastly experience,british airways t5 galleries south lounge at heathrow was a ghastly experience and the lounge was rather crowded around lunchtime far too few staff and any empty tables littered with used plates and glasses with far two few staff clearing up empty cutlery containers at the buffet and many dishes with no food had not been replenished subsequently went to the lounge at the b gates which was emptier and a more pleasant experience when checking into galleries south why did the staff not redirect us to the lounge at the b gates,3rd November 2015,London Heathrow Airport,2
M Edwards,a very poor experience,first visit to the new british airways lounge in singapore t1 bad start i am travelling first class and was looking forward to an exceptional experience in the concorde room except im not i walked in and there is only one chair type sitting area available so i went to sit down to be informed abruptly that i couldnt sit there as it was reserved who for i inquired to be told a vip yes i said thats me a first class passenger paying for the privilege no that didnt wash so i tried the main lounge absolutely full to the brim seems someone has underestimated the footfall needed in changi so all in all no points for a very poor experience,23rd October 2015,Singapore Changi Airport,1
T Uren,most disgusting place,the british airways lounge at t5 south heathrow airport was most disgusting place i have ever been in the cloth covered seats were threadbare filthy with stains all over them where we first sat it was beside the coffee  tea  hot chocolate dispensers we had to move from there because of the broken webbing in the seats we moved to near the tv room very hard to find a clean seat or an area where there were no dirty dishes leftover food and crumbs on the floor it took a staff member 50 minutes to remove the used dishes i don’t know how long they were there before we arrived; they removed the dishes and wiped all the crumbs on to the floor  it was only about 9pm that i saw a staff member with a vacuum cleaner i think that was because it was due to close up for the night soon; i would have been willing to pay the 30 pounds for access to one of the privately owned lounges we have used before,20th October 2015,London Heathrow Airport,1
C Koo,tables and floor so dirty,went to the british airways terminal 5 galleries south lounge in the morning around 0800hrs it was so crowded and hardly found a seat eventually found one and the chair tables and floor were so dirty food choices are limited and refilled slow the knives and forks were terribly dirty there was a separate bar table for alcohol,16th October 2015,London Heathrow Airport,3
Tim Pinkstone,food reduced dramatically,not sure what has happened in the time since i last visited this british airways lounge at terminal 5 heathrow july 2015 as the choice and quality of food on offer appears to have been reduced dramatically given that it was hardly generous in the first place this is somewhat surprising a small choice of fruit vegetables and yoghurts appear to have been removed entirely and the only food available were some tired sandwiches disappointing,13th October 2015,London Heathrow Airport,5
Alan Wan,place is filthy with crumbs,used this british airways aena miro lounge at barcelona airport every year for the past three years it is quite smart looking and has comfortable seating i am currently sitting here and must say the soft product has gone downhill i enquired about a shower  it i didnt have a towel and would cost €10 for the pack the food choice is very limited crisps a few filled rolls they used to have cava but not today the coffee is broken and the place is filthy with crumbs and uncleared tables,28th September 2015,Barcelona Airport,4
B Holmes,first class lounge didn't have champagne,what is british airways playing at they seem lost with no identity simple things like the toilets americans have this ghastly habbit of putting cracks down the sides of toilet doors so you have no privacy british airways would build british style toilets with total privacy but this is gone the first class lounge didnt have champagne  no champagne in the lounge on a £6000 flight are you kidding me the wifi didnt work the power ports next to the seating area didnt work the food was awful,20th September 2015,Boston Logan Airport,1
B Holmes,"furniture is worn, their isn't much seating",the concorde room is supposed to be the top tier lounge from british airways at both heathrow terminal 5 and jfk  whilst the concorde room is one of the nicer lounges ive been in its certainly not a patch on virgin or cathay pacific lounges at terminal 3 the furniture is worn there isnt much seating at busy times and getting some table service in the lounge area can take ages british airways seems to have lost its first crown and doesnt seem interested in getting it back,20th September 2015,London Heathrow Airport,4
Gareth Bronkhorst,lounge is more premium economy than first,i am a frequent visitor to the british airways first class lounge at lhr terminal 5 in comparison with other lounges to the likes of the pier in hong kong and the qatar airways lounge in doha this british airways lounge is more premium economy than first its a perfectly nice place to pass the time before your flight the lounge is very spacious so a lot of seating on offer but there are many times where space is limited as the lounge does get very crowded i love the self service champagne bar they have the food section is a massive let down when i compare to the club lounge the selection of food on offer is far more limited my recent visit was in the morning and to give them their credit the selection was very good and there as a lot on offer other times i have used the lounge at dinner with limited choices they have menus so you are able to place your food order with a member of staff but again very limited options and portions so small you feel hungry after eating one major letdown i find is their bathrooms  when you leave the nice surroundings of the lounge to use the bathroom facilities you really feel where they cut some costs and its a huge let down from the rest of the lounge the lounge is okay not show stopping like what is on offer in some asian airports but a perfectly acceptable place to pass the time,19th September 2015,London Heathrow Airport,7
B Wijesinghe,"one of the nicest, smaller ba lounges",this is an excellent recently refurbished british airways lounge it offers various sitting and dining areas staff friendly and attentive from the lounge reception to the sitting and dining areas the buffet dining area offers nice views of the tarmac with good quality food and wine or other  beverages nearby the sitting areas offer tarmac and terminal b interior views the washrooms were clean computer terminals and free wifi are offered along with magazines and newspapers the lounge was fairly full due to the aircraft being the a380 plus being also used by oneworld  executive club members however there were seats available and it didnt feel overcrowded this is one of the nicest smaller ba lounges that ive used,18th September 2015,Washington Dulles Airport,10
Richard Dalgleish,lounges look so dated and tired,my first visit to the british airways lounges at heathrow t5 and i tried both i dont recall how long t5 has been operational but by the look of the british airways lounges it must be 50 years much of the furniture is very scruffy tables are scratched and carpets look grubby it reminded me of second rate hotels in the 1960s the facilities and food seemed pretty good and plenty of staff to keep it tidy but oh dear the lounges look so dated and tired come on british airways why not smarten themm up a bit,8th September 2015,London Heathrow Airport,5
Barry Halliwell,british airways should do better,british airways has several flights every day from zurich so they ought to be able to set up their own lounge in the aspire lounge the sofas were dirty with multiple stains the food was basic newspaper selection was poor and the wines were cheap british airways should be able to do better than this,8th September 2015,Zurich Airport,3
Andrew Hickling,some refurbishment under way,i have been using the british airways terminal 5 galleries north and south lounges since they opened in 2008 in recent years the lounges have been showing their age and the condition of some of the furnishings are tired and dirty im pleased to say on my last visit that there is some refurbishment under way but still work to do the bathrooms need an upgrade from the basic white fittings the catering has improved but the wifi is hit and miss depends on usage i suppose the lounge needs to be cleaned more often when guests leave as it becomes overrun with plates glasses and food,7th September 2015,London Heathrow Airport,7
Nick Lester-Davis,happy to spend an hour there,the british airways galleries north lounges at heathrow terminal 5 are large but usually very busy on this occasion i arrived at 7am and had a good choice of food and drink a variety of breakfast rolls cereal and fruit with different types of fruit juice and coffee on previous occasions arriving at 10am i have found the food offering poor  hitting a gap between breakfast and lunch with little except stale pastries reading material good except they will not stock the guardian as is wifi happy to spend an hour there,28th August 2015,London Heathrow Airport,7
Jennifer Holford,a rather claustrophobic room with no view,catullo lounge at verona airport a rather claustrophobic room with no view which would seat about 20 people also a separate smoking room only in italy a chiller stocked with a reasonable selection of alcoholic and soft drinks a coffee machine offering espressos a chiller containing oranges and apples and fruit yogurts and a huge plate of unappetising prepacked longlife salami rolls and sponge cakes all the italian newspapers + 1 copy of the london times laptops available but we didnt use them so cant comment on wifi you would probably have more fun using the public areas of the airport than sitting in here although it is quiet if you wanted to work,24th August 2015,Verona Airport,5
Steve Pilibbossian,liked the afternoon tea sandwich selections,galleries lounge at terminal 3 heathrow airport was an excellent lounge with plenty of space it can get quite full inside during afternoon hours nice selection of of food and drink items liked the afternoon tea sandwich selections and my kids loved the hot pasta dishes great service by staff,17th August 2015,London Heathrow Airport,10
M Nal,"an enjoyable, relaxing 2 hours",opposite departure gate receptionist busy speaking to her friend on the phone so we had to wait for her to finish her conversation a modern lounge clean odd shaped lounge food good service good  internet plenty magazines an enjoyable relaxing 2 hours,15th August 2015,Washington Dulles Airport,8
Diana Pincott,first time i appreciated the real benefit of a lounge,i was taken to this british airways lounge after using the aa admiral lounge at d gates a warm welcome and assurance that staff would notify passengers of the whereabouts of the delayed flight to london this is a cavernous lounge with many separate areas including a kind of play room for families on a sunday evening the peace and quiet in the lounge was calming one downside is that in some seating areas it was difficult to find power points to recharge my phone food and beverages average although there was a good choice limited reading material wifi excellent staff super friendly and kept us informed of the delayed flight this was the first time i appreciated the real benefit of a lounge when the flight was delayed by 3 hours stretching the layover to 8 hours,15th August 2015,Miami Airport,9
Mike Bullen,i will let you draw your own conclusion,usually very good but when arriving it was being used by cathay pacific and i was told to go away and come back sometime later as it was quite full  i will let you draw your own conclusion,6th August 2015,Chicago O'Hare Airport,4
D Preston,less crowded and cleaner than usual,less crowded and cleaner than usual but still had to clear away other peoples rubbish cups sauces etc to be able to sit somewhere i cant believe that the catering has continued to decline but it has didnt spend much time in the lounge as british airways believe that it is acceptable to have business class passengers queuing for bag drops and check ins for over 45 minutes,3rd August 2015,London Heathrow Airport,4
C Lindsay,all very tired and uncomfortable,very poor breakfast selection dried up rolls to the point of hard no other selection available had to ask for toast all very tired and uncomfortable,2nd August 2015,London Heathrow Airport,2
G Fedele,british airways is not taking care of the issue,an update of a previous review from another customer three months after a fire and no reciprocal lounge facilities or vouchers for food and drink i asked at the checkin counter how is it possible that british airways is not taking care of this issue the person in the counter was very aggressive: alitalia will not let us use their lounges  and the other lounge is already too busy the point is that british airways is not taking care of the issue,24th July 2015,Rome Fiumicino Airport,1
M Hawthorn,the only downside was the lack of power facilities,i wish british airways operated lounges that were more like this third party facility the staff here in vienna was polite welcoming explained all the lounge facilities to us and was generally interested in customer service sadly that is something that british airways has lost in the past 10 years this lounge is located before immigration and the gate security so you need to allow 1525 minutes to board subject to time of day great range of food and beverages in the lounge nice seating areas and the only downside was the lack of power facilities for laptop and recharging my phone,22nd July 2015,Vienna Airport,7
M Nal,it's not really first class,its not really first class should be advertised as business class food ok  plenty of seating plenty of magazines but way overcrowded when we visited but first class lounge i dont think so i tried the turkish airlines business lounge in istanbul   that should be advertised as first  having said that its getting crowded in their lounge as well now,19th July 2015,London Heathrow Airport,6
Bob Motto,starting to look a little dated and tired now,the british airways lounges at terminal 5 in chicago are starting to look a little dated and tired now there are two lounges  one small first class lounge overlooking the tarmac and the other larger lounge opposite next to the food court the first class lounge is small and cramped with very little in the offering of food and drinks it is also looking dirty too with plates and glasses taking a lot of time to be removed too the lounge although has nice views over the tarmac did get too busy so i went across to the other terraces lounge here they offer preflight dining as well as seating areas and again very limited offerings of food and drinks this lounge does look cleaner but feels very dark as there is no natural light again the lounge is small but soon got busy with passengers as the departure time drew nearer,17th July 2015,Chicago O'Hare Airport,5
R Gonzaga,spacious and impressive offerings,i used this lounge as a customer with qatar airways spacious and impressive offerings of alcohol but thats about it food on offer in the morning was abysmal a few dry muffins cereal yoghurt and sliced cold turkey no showers to avail of it needs a better selection of food preferably some warm offerings otherwise it was adequate,12th July 2015,Philadelphia Airport,4
H Kerrigan,british airways is enticing customers to use other airlines,it is disgraceful that british airways treats its club europe and executive cub members with such disdain and contempt two months after a fire and no reciprocal lounge facilities or vouchers for food and drink british airways is enticing customers to use other airlines,7th July 2015,Rome Fiumicino Airport,1
James King,this lounge is in serious need of a makeover,given heathrow is bas home base you would expect their lounge facilities to be of good order unfortunately that is not the case as my recent visit outward journey highlighted a number of failings notably quality of food overcrowding and general ambiance this lounge is in serious need of a makeover and a new catering company needs to be introduced on my inbound journey i decided not to use the lounge and chose instead the general t5 facilities which were of a much better standard albeit not free,23rd June 2015,London Heathrow Airport,1
Michael Davies,the lounge is spacious,this lounge is shared between many airlines airside at the international terminal the lounge is spacious with a few secluded quiet areas overlooking the airfield a friendly barman with a full choice of complimentary beers wines and spirits nice choice of soup sandwiches cheese cakes etc at self service buffet but no hot meals the lounge staff came round with mini cheesecakes and were happy to take your order for drinks there are showers but i didnt use them relatively short walk to the departure gates,22nd June 2015,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,9
Mark Schultz,"comfortable, clean, nice showers and restrooms",im a fairly frequent visitor to this lounge it is very busy and you might want to go to the lounge on the south side or the terminal 5b lounge however i find north side comfortable clean nice showers and restrooms the liquor is quite good and is free food is nice quite a decent breakfast light snacks the rest of the day a good selection of magazines and speedy wifi,18th June 2015,London Heathrow Airport,9
F Chambers,it wasn't too crowded when i visited,the old ba lounge at schipol was small cramped had a poor selection of food and the staff were indifferent at best and unfriendly at worst  the new lounge has managed to retain all of those things with an added 15 minute walk through a temporary tunnel from the terminal building the only positive things i can say about this place is that the air conditioning works and it wasnt too crowded when i visited  i have visited ba and partner lounges worldwide  this one is the worst by miles not recommended obviously,12th June 2015,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,2
Alan Lacey,new but cramped and uninviting,new but cramped and uninviting no pcs so if you dont have a laptop its a 15 minute trek back though the airport to find the internet facility no information boards and staff offer no information unless asked no update announcements i arrived for a 650 pm flight and it was already known that there was at least a three hour delay but this was not mentioned  the aircraft was still on the ground at ams and had to do a rotation to gatwick and back before our flight  the flight eventually took off at midnight  during that time there were no announcements no apology and passengers were sharing information they gleaned by questioning the staff at the desk even when they called the flight at 1045  presumably to turf us out of the lounge  after a 10 minute walk to the gate we found the aircraft was still disembarking no offer of food vouchers during the 5 hour delay and the small plate of sandwiches soon disappeared around 7 pm leaving us with crisps or crackers really not good enough and should be scored zero for comfort food and service,5th June 2015,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,1
D Stead,a little difficult to find,a little difficult to find turn left after security past london news aka wh smith follow signs and it is on the fourth floor although that isnt very clear nice lounge large and pleasantly decorated with comfortable chairs and good position for plane spotters we arrived around 1pm there was a small but nice fresh salad bar soup various sandwiches and fruit nuts crisps all constantly replenished the only sweet things were biscuits next to the coffee as we were leaving at 6pm it seemed hot food was being served a good selection of wines spirits soft drinks juices tea coffee you need to ask for champagne and i did a lot staffs were all very pleasant & helpful if you require power points the only ones i could see were at the back of the lounge in the corner opposite the wines & spirits personally i think there should have been some more dotted about as most people require them,3rd June 2015,London Gatwick Airport,4
A Macarthur,didn't want to leave to be honest,comfortable seating good wifi ok food and snacks parked ourselves in the little nook with the 18 year old glenlivet didnt want to leave to be honest,31st May 2015,Glasgow Prestwick Airport,4
C Hamilton,lately every thing has gone downhill,after reading all the reviews i wonder does ba actually have anyone reading these complaints have they ever responded we travel to the usa often and when we do we use the lounges lately every thing has gone downhill in amsterdam schiphol selection was sparse heathrow too crowded people laying on couches asleep taking up seating space food selection was boring,29th May 2015,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,3
M Cadger,very large with plenty of seating,first the good points  its very large with plenty of seating and staff were friendly plus you can pay at door if not on ticket that includes entry or have required membership level has lager on draught which you never see in uk lounges on the poor side  if you are used to ba lounges in uk do not expect anything like galleries for food and drink options  limited to small rolls with cheese or chorizo crisps or small pastries basic stock of spirits and limited wines wifi signal was not great but thats not unusual in smaller airports,29th May 2015,Alicante Airport,2
D Chamberlain,it was even worse than before,very poor this is the 5th time i have been to the lounge and against expectations it was even worse than before overcrowded hot poor food lame selection of drinks inconsistent internet and a location which is remarkably inconvenient this is lounge to miss staff what staff noone showed an interest and little action to clean refresh the food or make us feel welcome quite why ba continue with it i am not sure  i can only assume that none of their staff have used it,29th May 2015,Lisbon Airport,2
D Chamberlain,relaxed and welcoming,very good space excellent staff good views range of drinks disappointing and predictable food the t3 lounge is very good  a wide range of different sitting spaces great views of the runways and aircraft delightful staff and a very strong range of drinks relaxed and welcoming the minus is that the food offering has remained the same for at least 2 years and is modest in its range and quality  disappointing,29th May 2015,London Heathrow Airport,4
J Clark,quite a tight little lounge however adequate,quite a tight little lounge however adequate i was the first in for the 920 flight to lhr nice selection of breakfast foods and drink papers and magazines all in order the wifi was a bit slow and dropped quite frequently interestingly there were quite a few birds yes birds in the lounge that made it feel quite exotic obviously not a feature but watching the sing and fly around my head did make me smile the lounge was between gates 22 and 26 and our gate was 11 which did mean a bit of a schlep to the gate,29th May 2015,Dubai Airport,4
C Moreira,showers with simple products and poor hygiene,british airways both in first class as the executive uses the new t3 in sao paulo business lounge tam the lounge has modest buffett slow wi fi showers with simple products and poor hygiene in both bathrooms which was causing me dissatisfaction totally unacceptable traveling first class and across precarious hygiene,9th May 2015,Sao Paulo Guarulhos Airport,2
William Delaney,absolute disgrace,absolute disgrace ba should be ashamed but obviously are not there are enough negative reviews online  but it has to be experienced to be believed filthy torn upholstery food selection that resembles a self service cafeteria in a 1970s service station on the motorway i was sent a survey by text from ba as i walked out of the lounge after being there for 5 minutes i let them have my thoughts and they did call me they assured me the lounge was going to have a multi million pound refurbishment  great but it doesnt help me and as i pointed out why is the lounge allowed to fall into this state of disrepair,9th May 2015,London Heathrow Airport,1

Christopher Slater-Walker,this is nothing like a good lounge,theres nothing like a good lounge before your flight to make things easier  and this is nothing like a good lounge it is the worst lounge ive ever used having said that it isnt quite as bad as some other reviews across the internet might lead you to believe we arrived about 90 minutes before our british airways flight from bordeaux to london gatwick and the whole club europe checkin process was very friendly and smooth we were issue with an invitation to the lounge; you then have to go through security no fast track of course and present your invitation to the cafe news on the airside they will then give you the code for the lounges front door you have to enter this yourself; the lounge has no staff at all however the member of staff at the cafe was very pleasant there is a vending machine serving hot drinks which i found acceptable but be aware that the default choice adds sugar to everything which i did not want there are a couple of local wines in a cooler and various spirits with soft drinks and mixers in the cooler a few food items are available; in our case since we had a morning flight there were some quite fresh croissants and pains au chocolat which were actually quite good the seating is rather old but not uncomfortable the lounge itself was mercifully quiet which i suspect is usually the case for what is most probably a mainly holiday destination some of the tables could have used a quick clean but nothing serious here so all in all if you can get a good price for your business class seat it may be worth it for the additional preflight comfort but anything like standard business class prices are definitely more than its worth paying for this lounge,9th May 2015,Bordeaux Airport,2
B Motto,appears to have less seats than the old lounge,i visited the new british airways lounge yesterday after a 25 minute treck across the roof tops of the terminal building exposed to the elements do bare in mind that the 25 minute treck is just to get the new lounge you will need to add at least 40 minutes to get to the departure gates & through security the new lounge appears to have less seats than the old lounge it is narrow & cramped & you still need to leave the lounge to use washroom facilities the refreshments are very poor nothing as improved in this area so still a very poor selection of drinks & food & snacks the furnishings are trendy as opposed to being comfortable & functional as well as being cramped with little privacy if you want to have your own space at the moment i would not entertain visiting the british airways lounge until the building work has been completed towards the end of 2015 as it is not worth the effort it takes to reach the lounge after check in or leave the lounge to get to the departure gate once again british airways have missed the boat on redesigning something which could be wonderful for their passengers,9th May 2015,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,2
A Patterson,hostess was pleasant,read some poor reviews but we had a few hours to wait so thought we should at least try the lounge the hostess was pleasant and promptly checked us in and provided a quick overview lots of seating was available so we picked a couple of seats with power outlet the seats were well maintained clean and comfortable a couple of ladies came around frequently to clear dishes and we found them very pleasant food was a nice potato and leek soup and sandwiches sandwiches werent the best good selection of refreshments would happily return,9th May 2015,Edinburgh Airport,4
C Perree,dirty plates cups and rubbish left on most tables,i use this lounge five times a year today i arrived from a 12 hour flight and had a four hour stop over before my next flight i arrived in the lounge at 845am  it was heaving no comfortable chairs to sit in and relax after a long flight dirty plates cups and rubbish left on most tables i went to the ladies loo which had a long queue but very clean  and for a shower which i did not have to wait for which were clean and very good sadly the lounges area seems to be full to bursting on most occasions when i visit  it used to be a quiet relaxing lounge but on two occasions i have left and used my priority pass for the quieter no1 lounge downstairs ba really need to enlarge this lounge as it really doesnt cope with the volume of passengers using it anymore the staff are always helpful but there does need to be more of them in busy periods the food is of very good quality and choice much better than on the flights,9th May 2015,London Gatwick Airport,4
Alan Lacey,quite the worst lounge i've seen anywhere,a shocker  quite the worst lounge ive seen anywhere ba should be ashamed to have its name outside the ambience of a suburban bus station no food youd actually want to eat limited drinks options curt reception staff and grotty toilet the harrods cafe just outside is a better option,2nd April 2015,Lisbon Airport,1
A Patterson,received an excellent welcome,on entering the lounge we received an excellent welcome from a very pleasant hostess who checked us in promptly heading to the seating area we were again welcomed by another staff member who escorted us to a couple of seats by the window she took the time to explain the lounge layout and brought us some water throughout our stay the staff were extremely pleasant and attentive clearing glasses promptly and refilling water glasses the lounge was clean and seats comfortable and in good condition electrical sockets were conveniently located for access to power food was soup and a good selection of sandwiches cant comment on quality as we didnt partake a good selection of tea coffee beer wines and spirits were available,2nd April 2015,Vancouver Airport,5
Michael Davies,comfortable and ample seating,nice lounge in t3 comfortable and ample seating beer available on draft which is a nice touch wine spirits and soft drinks wifi speed good enough for emails and web browsing and easy to log on sandwiches light snacks and soup only downside is that there is no view please be aware that to get from the lounge to the g gates involve getting on the shuttle train  so allow enough time they make announcements when the flight is ready for boarding i can confirm that the lounge does have its own toilets,24th March 2015,Rome Fiumicino Airport,4
Stephen Guerrier,this lounge is an absolute disgrace,this lounge is an absolute disgrace lounge filthy toilets disgusting and food terrible baked beans curry and carrot soup what a cliche there is some really serious work to be done here,1st March 2015,London Heathrow Airport,2
P Spencer,lounge is a disgrace for a national carrier,this lounge is a disgrace for a national carrier at its home hub the lounge is way overdue for a refurbishment  the chairs are old tatty and falling apart the food is plentiful but poor and self service  so breathed and coughed over for hours,21st February 2015,London Heathrow Airport,1
Ryan Lester,just awful. way too many people,just awful way too many people food is terrible i tried to have a beer but all of them were too warm plus there isnt much of a variety much heineken tiger or nothing wifi is slower than a 1990s dial up internet line i travel quite often but even though im a silver member i rarely use the lounges anymore i head elsewhere,7th February 2015,London Heathrow Airport,1
B Harrison,dreadful new lounge,dreadful new lounge there is a 50 minute walk to the gate via a temporary roof walkway till april i was told by the time you have trekked over the roof of the airport it is not worth it the lounge is small sparse cramped few facilities even the toilets are outside only breakfast items were small cartons of corn flakes no milk provided thanks ba awful lounge not worth the visit,4th February 2015,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,1
C O'Brien,staff that begrudgingly go about their jobs,way too busy staff that begrudgingly go about their jobs beginning to think that my membership of the executive club is now far less appealing than it used to be i have travelled extensively on business and generally have a far better experience with emirates or singapore airlines even the lufthansa lounge at heathrow has a better ambience ba need to take the time to give this place a much needed uplift if customers paying premium fares help ba survive more needs to be done to ensure they dont go looking for the premium service they pay for elsewhere,30th January 2015,London Heathrow Airport,1
Chris Haslam,standards have continued to drop every time i visit,lounge was dirty very dirty when i visited at 0915 on 27th january staff are beyond rude and standards have continued to drop every time i visit have they had a pay cut as they appear seriously unhappy and make an effort to be difficult and offhand to us paying customers sadly this is something i have noted onboard as well during last 2 long haul flights to chengdu and back product is well below asian airline competitors and lufthansa and air france are ahead of ba in the business class game amenities catering and service onboard club world are a joke and i guess the only satisfied travellers are those who have never flown other airlines apart from ba,30th January 2015,London Heathrow Airport,1
R Buxton,cramped with uncomfortable chairs,all of the ambience and comfort of a hospital waiting room cramped with uncomfortable chairs arranged in squares with very few tables for plates and glasses poor selection of unappetizing food no showers no flight information displays very difficult to access with wheelchair  lifts are behind padlocked fire doors the most disappointing lounge i have visited,27th January 2015,Rio De Janeiro Airport,1
D Moore,loud and messy chaos,busy busy busy more people in the lounge than at the bars and restaurants outside nowhere to sit for the first hour then table sharing and bag stacking for the rest of my stay staff couldnt keep up with the mess and catering demand aside from the 12hr delay the ba lounges have gone downhill fast loud and messy chaos,2nd January 2015,New York JFK Airport,3
S Bain,ba - why do you bother with this lounge,awful no still bottled water  have to use a machine linked to the mains only a hot soup type thing and no other hot food dried sandwiches horrible coffee ba  why do you bother with this lounge,2nd January 2015,Calgary Airport,2
R Whitehouse,the worst airport lounge i have experienced,i visit toulouse nearly every week and this is the worst airport lounge i have experienced food selection poor drinks even worse which is unbelievable given were in france  wheres the wine interior decor is horrendous the yellow red and green faux leather seats make it look like a wacky warehouse its a shared lounge too and therefore way too cramped ba nearly always has a full flight whenever i travel to tls so i would expect them to help push for a lounge that its business travellers deserve,2nd January 2015,Toulouse Airport,2
D Chamberlain,disappointingly cramped crowded and bare,disappointingly cramped crowded and bare this was a surprisingly disappointing lounge with a paucity of refreshments and even these were in short supply given the significance of schipol i was a little taken aback by the limited facilities no loos inside the lounge for example the staff were courteous but little else shone,2nd January 2015,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,3
D Chamberlain,helpful staff good refreshments in terms of quality and variety,a good experience helpful staff good refreshments in terms of quality and variety the lounge itself disappoints a little as it has no bathroom facilities inside it and it is a rather plain room but more than adequate wifi was good and i suspect much could be improved by altering the seating plan and providing washrooms great location next to security and a pleasant enough stay,2nd January 2015,Athens Airport,4
Guy Senior,great 'outdoor' terrace overlooking the concourse,a totally different experience from the usual ba self service arrangement which can be great or not so great everything is served from cooked to order meals in private booths to drinks at the bar generally of top class hotel fit out and a great outdoor terrace overlooking the concourse get there early to fully enjoy it the only annoying matter was the irritating background music switch it off,2nd January 2015,London Heathrow Airport,5
M Araujo,i liked its quietness,i liked its quietness its cosy with comfortable sofas food options are limited but just enough for my needs : rice pasta chicken curry meatballs cheese salad bar snacks wine selection is small and champagne is selfservice the staff are attentive at reception and in the lounge they come around with hot canapes,2nd January 2015,Singapore Changi Airport,5
Jennifer Holford,the atmosphere was quiet,my partner and i spent a relaxing couple of hours in this lounge the atmosphere was quiet big comfy sofas and chairs a good range of soft drinks beverages and alcoholic drinks available as well as fresh fruit and yogurts in the fridges canapes sandwiches nuts and cakes we didnt need wifi so cant comment on whether it was available previous reviewers have stated that the lounge doesnt have its own loos not true it does but we did not see any showers available,2nd January 2015,Rome Fiumicino Airport,3
T Stead,pretty poor for a first lounge,pretty poor for a first lounge ive used plenty of the major airlines first class lounges: qantas cathay emirates american etc: and considering this is the first class lounge at bas flagship terminal; i was pretty unimpressed firstly the breakfast was awful the scrambled eggs on the buffet were more milk than egg the coffee was out of a machine: no trained barista and the menu that was available was very limited i also had to queue for the toilets: not a shower just the toilets maybe this can happen in the business lounge but you just wouldnt expect this in first then its the little things i sat in quite a comfy seat with decent views but i could not charge my phone as there was no usb amenities also they had international power outlets but not australiannew zealand and i had already packed my adapters in my checked baggage these are the type of small items that with a little thought can make a big difference to ones comfort whilst travelling sorry ba but youve failed id look at what cathay pacific have done in hong kong and qantas in sydney i love the qantas first lounge in sydney but cathays first class lounge in hong kong is spectacular,19th November 2014,London Heathrow Airport,1
M Nunes,lounge comfortable snacks and drinks sufficient,lounge comfortable snacks and drinks sufficient unable to relax due to noisy kids and to top it all a mouse was spotted running around near our bags flight delayed by over 2 hours this lounge closes at 830 unfair if your flight is delayed and you have paid for this privilege,19th November 2014,Orlando Airport,3
D Chamberlain,really much improved since my last visit,really much improved my last visit here in may the food was plentiful and of good quality the wine selection improved and the cleaning service coped well with a busy lounge the dramatic improvement in internet is also noteworthy  no longer the inappropriate scratchcard system and now good quality wifi to which you can connect direct helpful staff and wonderful views excellent  well done on the improvements,28th October 2014,Madrid Barajas Airport,4
Pat Marwick,an open bland fairly uninteresting space,ba has no control over this lounge as it is shared unbelievable that a brand new terminal would have shared facilities it is an open bland fairly uninteresting space with a section cordoned off for first class pax food and drink the same for everybody what is totally ludicrous is that in a brand new lounge in a brand new terminal there is only one mens and one womens toilet utterly inadequate,28th October 2014,Mumbai Airport,3
K Lee,there was a good selection of sandwiches,i had an evening flight and the lounge was overcrowded i travelled with a friend and it has very hard to find a place to sit down there wasnt much space to relax in either once you found a spot the plus side is that there was a good selection of sandwiches and decent wifi,22nd October 2014,London Heathrow Airport,4
A Requena,really crowded dirty and untidy,i had the opportunity to visit the ba first class lounge in terminal 5 it was really crowded dirty and untidy i had to make queue to use the bathroom the food from the buffet was poor and the white wine was warm,4th October 2014,London Heathrow Airport,2
D Chamberlain,many good features but let down by wifi,many good features but let down by wifi you have to pay after 15 minutes of free use and food quality is fine but variety and quantity is disappointing the drinks selection was very good the comfort certainly good and it was a busy though comfortable atmospherenot that easy to find it is friendly enough the wifi issue is a considerable downside and the food was simply not plentiful enough  long periods without anything other than chipscrisps and then narrow range drinks  of all types  were plentiful and good quality seating was comfortable though the lack of power sockets was a little surprising,4th October 2014,Barcelona Airport,3
Mark Niall,the lounge is modern and does its job,the lounge is modern and does its job we had a morning flight at 1030 the lounge was very crowded bordering on congested it is self service throughout being full made it a bit difficult to obtain food and drinks keep a reserved table and relax t the same time there are many worse lounges however ba should look at extending the area or redesigning to make the lounge less congested,4th October 2014,London Heathrow Airport,4
Y Morgan,very poor low grade business lounge,very poor low grade business lounge no champagne on offer unless you ask for it  but very few staff around to ask it looks tired with stained upholstery seats arranged in long functional rows along the walls  no different from the departure lounges i normally fly qatar or emirates  they both know how to do business class ba has either lost its way or lost interest its been dumbed down to accommodate silvergold card economy travellers fly qatar or emirates  even the virgin upper class lounge is better than this,4th October 2014,London Heathrow Airport,2
Guy Senior,very little food limited range of drinks,ba run lounges are usually good if sometimes overcrowded third party lounges like this vary this one was dreadful  very little food limited range of drinks no computer access and very hard to find i gave up and went to a bar to get a drink,4th October 2014,Hannover Airport,1
N Gates,fairly small and somewhat claustrophobic lounge,this is a fairly small and somewhat claustrophobic lounge the chairs are comfortable enough there is just about enough choice of drinks no campari but an extremely limited choice of nibbles or anything else to eat also a very limited choice of newspapers  no daily telegraph for example our amsterdam lounge experience was made singularly unpleasant by several lounge users conducting business into their mobile telephones at the top of their voices after over half an hour of this antisocial behaviour my wife got up and told them that they were making so much noise she was unable to concentrate on the book she was reading this lounge needs an area reserved for those who wish to utilise mobile telephones at the top of their voices we were glad to leave the lounge,4th October 2014,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,2
N Gates,the business lounge is large and busy but looks increasingly tired,after fast track  instead of being able to walk about thirty yards to the business club lounge passing through the first concorde lounge  you have to walk left descend a floor walk back under where you have just walked and then take an escalater up again what a nightmare i am a disabled passenger but i was not allowed to walk through the concord area to the business lounge  i was not amused certainly a userunfriendly route from fasttrack to the lounge the business lounge is large and busy but looks increasingly tired they have stopped providing the daily telegraph and at the drinks area they have stopped providing campari the chairs and carpets appear very wellused and some of them appear to be well beyond their sellby dates food provided was soso  good croissants but uninspiring lunch choices when this lounge opened it was wonderful today it does not hold a candle to the first concorde lounge which i have also used on eleven occasions although i recommend the lounge it is with some reservations,4th October 2014,London Heathrow Airport,3
Bill Atkins,staff are in the unenviable position of turning people away,this lounge has a real problem with us airways in oneworld all aa and us travelers are trying to use it as it is much nicer than the either the admirals club or us airways lounge staff are in the unenviable position of turning people away and denying guest privileges to keep it within the fire regulations for capacity ba clearly needs to restrict to only ba travelers and ec card holders jal has no problem doing the same with their first lounge in chicago due to space limitations,4th October 2014,Philadelphia Airport,4
A Matthews,this lounge is outdated needs a total refurb,this lounge is outdated needs a total refurb i would be less than impressed if i had paid club prices for the experience furniture old staff rude drink and food selection exceptionally poor you have to share a bottle of coke and the glasses are filthy and scratched and no wifi,4th October 2014,Rome Fiumicino Airport,1
Peter Walmsley,the new ba lounge is spacious,i think the earlier reviewer of this lounge must have been in a temporary lounge the new ba lounge is spacious probably bigger than it needs to be and looks great a much superior offering to what ba has to offer in other airports eg bkk and mia the wine selection is limited with two whites two reds and a champagne usual selection of beers and spirits good selection of sandwiches and cheese but no hot food other than heinz tomato soup  staff are attentive wifi is good with decent speed theres is no business centre and no tv screens so overall the lounge is a quiet area,4th October 2014,Singapore Changi Airport,4
D Chamberlain,it is tired and needs a considerable refit and upgrade,i want to like it so much as it was the first lounge i ever used  but it is tired and needs a considerable refit and upgrade positives: good supply of drinks of all types; nice open space; free wifi which is efficient negatives: wine was not cold; food was poor in terms of variety just cheesehamsalad but fine in terms of quality; unusually the staff were not attentive or helpful but that is unusual; poor seating space and decorfurniture really needs upgrade,4th October 2014,London Gatwick Airport,3
F Klajner,in short a disaster,a bad anomaly at the fairly new ataturk international airport in istanbul compared with the excellent star alliance lounge which i have also used in the past a scarred wooden floor with large dark gouges dirty armless chairs very closely spaced together dingy lighting a very limited and poor food and drink selection few information monitor screens located far from the boarding gates in short a disaster rivaled only by the american airlines lounge in lima peru,4th October 2014,Istanbul Airport,2
Russ King,staff are surprisingly friendly,it is a bit daunting when you first arrive but staff are surprisingly friendly and seemed genuinely interested in looking after you good baggage storage so you are free to enjoy three parts: the dining area  discreet cubicles with fast service and excellent food; a main lounge with various types of chairs to suit all needs; and a veranda like place that although it is inside has excellent views across the tarmac seating here is more like a conservatory spa and showers computerbusiness room but i didnt try any of these well worth getting to the airport 2hrs before your flight wifi a bit slow but adequate,30th August 2014,London Heathrow Airport,5
Russ King,this lounge is a room nothing more,this lounge is a room nothing more four serving people hovered around a minimal amount of stewed food totally disinterested only sweet was icecream at the other end of the lounge it didnt even have a flight screen no place to leave luggage unlike some other ba lounges food was terrible: tough and tasteless in the end i went to the qantas lounge  you are allowed there and they were wonderful  they have a chef to cook for you bas lounge is a disgrace no views of the apron  only of arrival loungeimmigration haphazard boarding meant long queues and no fasttrack so a long wait at the gate security,30th August 2014,Singapore Changi Airport,2
R Vines,it was overcrowded overheated and unpleasant,this lounge is generally ok but it wasnt when i arrived late morning on sunday it was overcrowded overheated and unpleasant most newspapers were unavailable having paid hundreds of pounds extra to fly business on holiday i left immediately and ended up in a cafe rouge i realize that lounges get busy at certain times of day but i dont understand why conditions need to be worse than at your average starbucks or even on this occasion café rouge i suggested to ba that they give me a refund they said they valued my loyalty but no oh well fortunately the flight was good but i am assuming lounges are taken into consideration when evaluating airlines for stars and recent lounge experiences have made me wonder if bas four stars might be too generous,21st August 2014,London Gatwick Airport,2
Jan Fenn,lounge was dated in poor disrepair and quite frankly grim,what a shock the lounge was dated in poor disrepair and quite frankly grim it needs refurbishing badly and it was way too small for the number of travellers using it the no 1 lounge is way better but they could learn a lot by visiting the virgin lounge at heathrow  it is a million times better ba need to buck their ideas up here,21st August 2014,London Gatwick Airport,2
D Arter,i was declined admittance to the business class lounge,despite having a ba business class ticket i was declined admittance to the business class lounge the very helpful polite and just lovely lady at the ba customer service counter informed my that my ticket wasnt the right type of business class ticket to gain access to the lounge given the fact i have a one world first class around the world ticket i have to ask what exactly is an acceptable ticket the gentleman at the business class counter also terribly polite and most sympathetic and helpful informed me that qantas frequent flyer club members are no longer allowed in the ba lounge as they no longer pay ba for the privilege british airways pick up your game,21st August 2014,London Heathrow Airport,1
N Berry,great lounge relaxing and food generally good,great lounge relaxing and food generally good  have noticed cuts in premium spirits crisps and total lack of decent magazines which is a shame as ba makes all its profit out of its business class passengers,21st August 2014,London Heathrow Airport,4
Kevin Tunnicliffe,good views of the apron and runways,excellent lounge from which ba could learn a great deal very comfortable seating with good views of the apron and runways and superb food the food was fresh and delicious with a station cooking rice or noodle stir fry dishes to order maybe the best hot food in an airport lounge i have ever experienced,21st August 2014,Toronto Pearson Airport,4
P Alderson,it looked congested and untidy,i was allowed access as i had just travelled to heathrow with ba in first my excitement at being allowed into this hallowed space was short lived it looked congested and untidy the service for anything from a full meal to a glass of water is waiter only empty glasses and used plates were waiting to be cleared from a lot of the tables as i had only recently eaten on the inbound flight i did not bother to order any food but still tried one of the booths in the dining area which seemed reasonably comfortable and private i moved to sit outside on the balcony overlooking the departures area as it felt less claustrophobic after waiting 10 minutes for a coffee i quickly drank it and went to the firstgold lounge which had a more comfortable and relaxing ambience,12th August 2014,London Heathrow Airport,3
P Miller,be prepared for disappointment,i had just earned my silver executive club membership and was looking forward to trying out a lounge on my own account without being a guest of one of my better traveled colleagues unfortunately my first experience was at one of the lounges at ben gurion it was small crowded and oppressively stuffy the decor was straight out of the 70s; huge dimly lit lampshades shiny brown worn polyester seat covers and chrome and smoked glass coffee tables adorned with sticky glass rings which was odd since the rest of the terminal seemed quite new once i found a seat i was reluctant to leave it unattended but eventually went to the refreshments counter where i eventually found a lukewarm bottle of beer but no suitable glasses there was food on offer as well but i gave it a miss as i did with the other facilities preferring to go back out into the main departure area which in comparison was bright clean and refreshingly air conditioned to be fair to ba though the lounge appears to be shared by many airlines so they probably dont have much influence over how its run just be prepared for disappointment if youre visiting this airport,5th August 2014,Tel Aviv Airport,2
A Evans,small and miserly stocked,a very small and miserly stocked lounge no hot food small selection of booze and no espresso,5th August 2014,,3
T Holder,very nice little and quiet lounge,very nice little and quiet lounge right at the back of the terminal staff were very attentive the food wasnt great and neither was the choice just a few sandwiches and biscuits to choose from the wifi was fast and the lounge was clean but there was a queue in front of the washrooms because there is pretty limited capacity,5th August 2014,Vancouver Airport,4
Michael Davies,an oasis of calm,an oasis of calm in what can be a busy terminal 3 always plenty of seats with many overlooking the runway it never seems busy here even though its used by american airlines and now us airways an 8am departure  good choice of continental breakfast items everything you would expect from a lounge,2nd August 2014,Manchester Airport,5
Gordon Wallace,good selection of food and drinks,the new lounge at glasgow is a vast improvement on the old one very well laid out good selection of food and drinks staff on the desk very helpful and the lounge staff very attentive at both replenishing fooddrinks as well as clearing used glasses etc away top tip sit in the whiskey snug hidden around the back and with no one in it only slight draw back is that its not immediately at the gate but can live with that,2nd August 2014,Glasgow Prestwick Airport,5
Clive Billingham,tables left dirty,first time in this lounge very disappointing 6pm food was curry chilli jacket potato with beans  really inspiring tables left dirty for over 15 minutes,2nd August 2014,London Heathrow Airport,2
G Hampton,front desk staff are extremely rude,lounge is ok but front desk staff are extremely rude and unhelpful we were travelling with small children and needed a little extra assistance but no such luck highlights yet again vast difference in treatment between uk ba lounges and those stateside where your gold card often seems as welcome as tax bill,2nd August 2014,Miami Airport,3
Tony Hall,there were no showers available,furnishings and refreshments fine for the amount of custom but there were no showers available and the nearby toilets were out of use the there computers available but the internet connection was extremely poor and very unreliable,2nd August 2014,Amsterdam Schiphol Airport,3
D Larmour,food quality has gone down,food quality has gone down especially if youre looking for any protein breakfast before transatlantic flight was largely a selection of pastries and other unhealthy options no cheese no eggs just lots of toast and low quality croissants the food bar is not well maintained and everything reeks of cheapness and cost cutting from the biscuits and crisps to the wine selection i asked for cheese and was rudely told theres none available before noon if then the toilets are often smelly and not clean enough there is often a queue to get in its a shame ba dont realize how this damages their brand theyve been cutting down on meals on board too of course but in the lounges its really apparent hardly worth paying the extra fares; better to save the money and take your own high quality comestibles perhaps,2nd August 2014,London Heathrow Airport,2
D Larmour,food minimal and very drab,pretty awful no wifi or printers working food minimal and very drab quite crowded not much space toilets far away outside,2nd August 2014,Rome Fiumicino Airport,2
D Stead,overall extremely disappointing,overall extremely disappointing i used the lounge on a saturday 10am  130pm large lounge with comfortable chairs and free wifi as you would expect little choice of newspapers no phonetablet charging points coffee etc available choice of wines and spirits if you are hungry i suggest you eat beforehand hot food consists of toast cold food consists of fruit salad plain yoghurt in a large bowl not single pots ham and cheddar cheese plus pastries & biscuits heathrow has slightly more choice incl hot food,2nd August 2014,London Gatwick Airport,4
L Shore,staff at t5 certainly didn't go to charm school,the british airways staff at t5 certainly didnt go to charm school awful choice of food ended up with a jacket potato lounge lacked character and looked dirty staff on the entrance uninterested and took no notice of me the toilets in the business lounge were so dirty i changed my mind about taking a shower,4th June 2014,London Heathrow Airport,2
D Chamberlain,this remains a disappointing lounge,for such a fantastic potential this remains a disappointing lounge wonderful views a very large area pretty good seating light and airy  all good however: after over an hour in here we are getting the first sign of a cleaner; food is almost non existent i mean this literally and the range and quality of drinks has declined over time inattentive staff the frustrating wifi system of getting scratchcards every 30 minutes and the paucity of refreshments leaves this well below bar the long trek to t4s would be fine if we had something better when we arrived,28th May 2014,Madrid Barajas Airport,2
Mark Boggis,staff unhelpful totally unimpressed,food non existent staff unhelpful totally unimpressed internet wireless not working correctly either cant wait to get on the plane and get out of this hole,28th May 2014,Rome Fiumicino Airport,2
Michael Davies,there are plenty of seats of many types,both the north and south lounges in t5a are superb reception staff always friendly despite some miserable people who seem to complain a lot and should be kicked back to the public areas the lounges are always busy but there are plenty of seats of many types the showers are excellent staffed by such friendly ladies and whilst there is often a queue to use the toilets they are spotlessly clean good choice of food of sandwiches salads and hot items the lentil and bean curry was spicy and excellent as was the thai red curry two types of perfectly cooked rice or baked potato wide range of alcoholic drinks the wifi is free easy to log on and of good enough speed despite many people using it and a great view over airport i always look forward to coming here,28th May 2014,London Heathrow Airport,5
G Sims,not made to feel especially welcome,not made to feel especially welcome and when we were there at lunchtime there were not many places left to sit not crowded but very busy the hot food surprisingly for me and very strange for foreign visitors was pea soup that was all  and some weird croutons uninspiring salad bar with no wow factor whatsoever and three types of freshlymade sandwiches  ham and cheese chicken prawn with rosemarie sauce all of them sorry to say utterly tasteless the good news is thank goodness the excellent wines available and champagne for that you have to ask an overworked but smiling waitress who will eventually bring it to where you are sitting usual premium spirits selection with mixers toilets men were frankly a bit grubby and dated and a tad smelly  not good enough more like a traditional english pub on a saturday night overall very underwhelmed with the whole experience and compared with other business class lounges at heathrow and overseas in middle east down at the bottom of the list  desperately needs upgrading to bring in line with competitors,28th May 2014,London Gatwick Airport,3
J Henson,warm and pleasant welcome on arrival,i visited this lounge on 24 may 2014 warm and pleasant welcome on arrival to the lounge the main lounge is effectively a rectangle with a small annex to one side with some additional seating and tables decent selection of english and french language newspapers but a more limited selection of magazines wifi worked well  it was easy to connect and i was pleased with the speed the lounge was relatively quiet when i visited and had a pleasant quiet atmosphere a menu was available on the food counter but the food selection is fairly limited  all cold food with some meat and some cheese sandwiches available along with nuts crisps cakes fruit and biscuits  i personally thought that although the selection was limited this was satisfactory given that it is a short haul outpost language luggage storage available toilet located outside lounge overall a pleasant albeit not amazing place to spend an hour before a flight,28th May 2014,Geneva Airport,4
A Hickling,friendly and efficient service,visited the concorde room on 2 may and used it for around ten hours i stored my hand luggage with the attendant and proceeded to the dining area for breakfast all food served in this lounge is waiter service and menus are scattered around the lounge for you to choose your selection from and change depending on the time of day if you visit the first galleries lounge opposite the concorde room you can request items from their buffet selection and they will be served to you in the concorde room there was a good choice of premium spirits and champagnes as well as teas coffees and soft drinks i booked one of the private cabanas when i organised my trip which is a dedicated day room with bed tv shower toilet free telephone use and room service you can request a cabana for a maximum of four hours its an oasis of calm within an oasis of calm i also had lunch and afternoon tea there good quality food and friendly and efficient service i also used the elemis spa facilities which can be booked twenty eight days in advance if you are a first passenger there is also a boardroom style facility to log on to the internet and printers so you need to produce any paperwork my only criticism is that some of the soft furnishings are beginning to wear slightly,12th May 2014,London Heathrow Airport,5
Kevin Tunnicliffe,very pleasant staff,smallish lounge shared by several airlines very pleasant staff and free bar for ba customers excellent showers mediocre food offerings other airline users pay for alcoholic beverages,1st May 2014,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,4
Annabel Wharton,lounge size is adequate but not much was done with it,rome fiumicino arrivals terminal is a nightmare but international departures terminal four is state of the art even on the busiest weekend of the year—canonization of john paul ii and john xiii—the space was remarkably civilized the terminal raised expectations for the executive lounge we were flying turkish airlines  in rome they use british airways executive lounge the lounge size is adequate but not much was done with it apart from a series of good abstract prints and a series of photographs of architectural details of rome the space is clinical solid blocks of rectilinear greybeige vinyl sofas and matching chairs suggest that travelers necessarily move in groups of ten –the squares are intimidating for parties of one or two but once these islands are occupied even by a single traveler they become impenetrable by others one side of the space is plate glass blindingly bright so only half of the seating cells can be comfortably occupied especially for travellers suffering from jet lag the initial unsettling affect of the antiintimate seating and hyper lighting is subtly exacerbated of other details of the ambiance the floor carpeted in a nondescript blue feltlike substance is not as might be expected flat rather it rises and falls in just such a way as to make you stumble internet connection is available but requires an inordinately complex set of interventions to access once acquired it is difficult to find one of the few plugs that is not already being used by another harried voyager the culinary experience like the digital environment is disconcerting we were arrived at 1 p lunchtime cereal and yogurt was on offer as well as croissants and cookies breakfast apparently lasts all day at the ba lounge there was a selfserve bar which included red and white wine the red came in a bordeaux bottle but it tasted like it had been decanted from a box our empty glasses stayed with us during the entirety of our wait,1st May 2014,Rome Fiumicino Airport,2
J Ritchie,disinterested staff,absolutely shocking stale and tasteless lumps of bread food in fact that i would be more likely to throw out disinterested staff without doubt with regards to the food on offer this was the worst id ever been to nothing to do with british airways incidentally we were given access by means other than our airline tickets,22nd April 2014,Rome Fiumicino Airport,2
Alan Wan,for a small airport this lounge was excellent,for a small airport this lounge was excellent it was elegant clean and had a respectable selection of food and beverage,22nd April 2014,Malta Airport,4
Christopher Slater-Walker,there is little food available,the worst business lounge ive ever seen there is little food available; what there was consisted of a few different small cakes i think packaged snacks and mixed nuts there is a reasonable selection of drinks both alcoholic and nonalcoholic but the ice was in an open ice bucket and mostly melted; driedup slices of lemon on a plate there is no separate bathroom; you have to use the general public ones outside the lounge the decor is a particularly unpleasant shade of pale purple all in all its a most unwelcoming prospect,16th April 2014,Sofia Airport,2
O Ekland,if hungry eat somewhere else,at osl ba uses the osl lounge owned by airport authorities i often take the late ba flight to lhr after work if hungry eat somewhere else  food and beverages are below standard for ba lounges decent selection of newspapers best feature: the lounge is wonderfully quiet so worth visiting after long day at work to wind down before the flight very comfortable chairs and sofas though not particularly modern or elegant and a quiet atmosphere i like it about 10 mins walk to ba gates from lounge,14th April 2014,Oslo Airport,4
C Padeste,the quality of the food is dropping,the quality of the food is dropping every time i spend some times in this lounge chilli con carne without proper rice ice cream fridge empty quality of wine getting lower and lower i also found surprising that nothing is done in the last year to fix some power sockets that do not work next to seat or on the pc table it seems that ba believe that quality of service is not important for the price of ticket you have to pay maybe they will have a wakeup call like lufthansa when people will fly different airlines,30th March 2014,London Heathrow Airport,3
K Sveningsen,the standard has gone downhill,i think the standard has gone downhill its not as clean as before the wine is mediocre no bread or nice cheese the coffee beans are not the same no more nice different cookies just a pot with a cookie thats has the taste of nothing i was happy to pay the price for club to be able to get in but as for now no way,30th March 2014,London Heathrow Airport,3
Alan Wan,lounge ambience was not the best but very functional,plenty of light snacks of crisps flapjacks brownies biscuits and soup the choice of drinks was impressive choice of wines beers and spirits the lounge ambience was not the best but very functional something to note if you arrive early the check in desks may not be open until a couple of hours before departure and the self service machines will no longer be available,30th March 2014,Jersey Airport,4
H Blumenthal,comfortable seating great showers and washrooms,you need to have the one world gold card to access this lounge if youre travelling business class lounge offers space; comfortable seating great showers and washrooms and a spa with a very good massage for free but most often fully booked a great buffet with a wide choice chilli con carne one of the best ive ever had with a number of dishes you can order from the waiters a huge wine selection of very good wines and vintage champagnes,11th March 2014,London Heathrow Airport,5
R King,spotlessly clean relaxing and fantastic views,spotlessly clean relaxing and fantastic views of airside and runway service by staff very friendly and welcoming there is storage for your luggage if you want to dump everything and relax or walkabout though newark airport has few shopsdutyfree lounge only has 1 shower the food really was amazing worth getting to the airport early enough to eat,7th February 2014,Newark Airport,5
Alan Wan,very spacious and great views,very spacious and great views we experienced breakfast and lunch which were adequate but not as good as the heathrow t5 lounge the hot food was too limited porridge and soup offerings were tasty and nice champagne,7th February 2014,London Gatwick Airport,4
Paul Whiteley,decent tarmac views,ba use the jal sakura business lounge at nrt spacious clean and a separate dining area if one wanted to eat decent tarmac views nice lounge and a pleasant way to spend an hour or so,29th January 2014,Tokyo Narita Airport,4
C Lambie,it is cramped not just at peak times,use this lounge 23 times a month and position is okay subject to which a gates you board from it is cramped not just at peak times and ba seem to have become complacent about improving this toilets can be very risky unless you catch at the moment they have just been cleaned and often filthy and unpleasant food is at travelodge level uk travellers will know what i mean and fails to match standards at some better european airline lounges staff at reception only want to see a card or boarding pass and i think these must be the ones that didnt make the grade at charm school dont get me wrong i like ba but their lounge standards including first here at terminal 5 are now poor,29th January 2014,,2
Paul Whiteley,i always find the lounge too busy to be comfortable,i appreciate this lounge is never going to be empty but i always find the lounge too busy to be comfortable on my last visit just before new year cups and glasses took a relative age to be removed and the food choices seemed less than usual along with having to queue to use the toilet ive had decent stays in this lounge but the last two visits havent been relaxing or pleasurable its got to the point where ive ended up at the espresso cafe at the very end of the southern part of t5,29th January 2014,London Heathrow Airport,3
D Chamberlain,disappointing and poor quality,disappointing and poor quality from the challenge in finding the lounge to the surly receptionist to the very poor range of snacks this was a real disappointment i was flying british airways and it is to be hoped that they will try to persuade the airport to improve this lounge small in size basic in furnishings poorly lit one bottle of wine only in the whole lounge and a choice of one type of beer snacks with very little choice and poor quality lavatories were outside of the lounge unhelpful staff,21st January 2014,Turin Airport,2
D Chamberlain,friendly staff and excellently located,much improve they have enlarged the lounge and offer a reasonable range of snacks sandwiches and drinks the beerwine is fine and the snacks of a good quality friendly staff and excellently located clean well maintained i suspect they will need to upgrade it more for the 2018 world cup as it is relatively basic by some standards but is none the less safe quiet clean and friendly i have been to this lounge many times it does its job,21st January 2014,St Louis Airport,3
Chris Willett,staff member was rude,i am a gold member with ba on 28th december i was flying to tampa with my wife and three youngsters that we care for access to the lounge was denied which i accepted but not having seen the notice not to remove refreshments when i took three small soft drinks and three packets of crisps out to the children i was virtually attacked on my return with a ba staff member waving his finger at me stating it was a massive no no for me to do this i was publicly humiliated with his loud out burst for what i thought to be a small crime the staff member was rude arrogant and had zero customer service skills i would like to name and shame but feel this would lower me to his level on our quick exit i did point out to him that i had seen numerous other clients taking stock from the lounge but this observation was ignored ba have responded to my complaint stating that they have passed my concerns onto the lgw management team,17th January 2014,London Gatwick Airport,2
J Tung,very dark and uninviting,busy lounge in t5a south before new year very dark and uninviting limited viewing area most of the seats face inward the building very limited choice of food  few sandwich one soup and some cakes good selection of wines but depends on where you sit good wifi service was very slow not attentive and the receptionists werent welcoming a very disappointing lounge,10th January 2014,London Heathrow Airport,3
J Tung,spacious seatingworking area,terrace lounge in aberdeen has just been renovated friendly staff spacious seatingworking area and good selection of soft drink also one redwhite wine on offer food is limited to sandwich and cakes but thats sufficient for a regional airport,10th January 2014,Aberdeen Airport,4
K Bong,it is absolutely appalling,this new lounge opened just a week ago it is absolutely appalling there is no food all the trays are empty juice dispensers are empty coffee machines dont work only a few packets of cheap biscuits in a basket when i asked the staff who was rude and unhelpful if the trays and juice dispensers would be refilled the answer was no and he walked away this was 10am the lounge looks pleasant and comfortable enough in the end orange juice was made available but we would have to approach the staff to ask for it wifi is not free,10th January 2014,Turin Airport,2
L Shurey,not an experience i will repeat,not an experience i will repeat  poor service very slow which in hindsight was a blessing given the quality of the food when it finally arrived to see how a lounge should be run fly qatar airways,6th January 2014,London Heathrow Airport,2
D Chamberlain,more spacious than you first think,this might not have the wow factor of terminal 5 lounges it is very good a fairly long trek to get there but efficient friendly professional more spacious than you first think good internet excellent range of wines food is good quality though a little lacking in variety and with tiny plates good variety of seating and very pleasant environment you can work relax sleep or whatever you need to here clearing up service seems a little under staffed as used plates and glasses can take a long time to be collected  but ba would benefit from more staff on this duty the ones who are there are good,30th December 2013,London Heathrow Airport,4
D Chamberlain,very efficient staff,bustle of the main terminal very efficient staff clearing away welcoming reception staff breakfast food is excellent wide selection of excellent wines and other drinks good internet and very clear information boards it does get busy of course but manages this well clean bathrooms,30th December 2013,London Heathrow Airport,5
D Chamberlain,the variety of food can be a little inconsistent,very good overall i have visited this lounge a number of times  the variety of food can be a little inconsistent at times but the quality is good with a good mix of cold and warm snacks salads etc good range of drinks and nice selection of wine  though it is a pity that the cava has seemingly been withdrawn comfortable large bright with natural light and excellent view of the runway  huge glass front the lounge which extends along its whole length reception is friendly and professional wifi system is frustrating  you have to collect scratchcards from reception which only last 30 minutes  seems unnecessary its a little bit of a challenge to find the lounge but well worth when you do,30th December 2013,Madrid Barajas Airport,4
R Lightbody,the lounge was quiet,fcolgw i entered the lounge after a long a hot journey to the airport the lounge was quiet and it was being shared by the other one world airlines there was no hot or cold food there were only crisps there were plenty of drink options i was very disappointed as british airways have a few flights out of rome to london heathrow london gatwick and london city,23rd December 2013,Rome Fiumicino Airport,2
R Vines,the pre-flight buffet was unappetizing,surprisingly poor the preflight buffet was unappetizing i found nothing i wanted to eat and the staffer on the door to that section keeping away other airlines passengers was unfriendly to the point of rudeness the main lounge is horribly lit you have to find someone if you want a glass of champagne and there are not that many staff around it is so different from virgins lounge at jfk im just confused by contrast the ba lounge at city airport in london is fine,23rd December 2013,New York JFK Airport,3
R Vines,staff serving was friendly and efficient,the ba allbusiness service to jfk was a fine flight the lounge at city is surprisingly good for a fairly small space the snacks and drinks were fine and staff serving was friendly and efficient the hike to the washrooms is tiresome,23rd December 2013,London City Airport,3
Richard Berger,the worst airport lounge i have visited,british airways galleries first lounge at jnb is the worst airport lounge i have visited ba should be absolutely ashamed to call this a lounge much less a first class lounge slow unusable internet poor or nonexistent service lousy food which is identical to the adjoining business lounge champagne sitting in lukewarm water with no ice for 2 hours,22nd November 2013,Johannesburg Airport,1
H Rowe,it was a let down to say the least,i received complimentary use of this lounge when i took an iberia flight that connected in ny i heard that ba has great lounges so i was looking forward to it it was a letdown to say the least i was greeted to 3 stale inchwide sandwich slivers on a tray set off to the side bottles of water had not been replenished i was starving and asked they would be replenishing fooddrinks etc i was told that everything would arrive around 6  when i asked this question it was about 2 pm it was also extremely hot in the lounge; hot to the point where certainly something must have been wrong with their air systems pay for use of this lounge not a chance in fact youd have to pay me,22nd November 2013,New York JFK Airport,2
M Thompson,very uncomfortable to sit in,easy to find but very uncomfortable to sit in choose between massive armchairs that are far too big or sit at the small tables that are used for eating on rock hard dining chairs good range of drinks on offer but limited snacks only 15 minutes wifi free any more you pay for,15th November 2013,Barcelona Airport,3
R Gordon,busy but not over-full,busy but not overfull i arrived for some lunch snacks before 1455 marrakech departure im vegetarian so it would be appreciated if the sandwiches could be labelled plenty of salad options and quiche or soup but plates are a bit on the small side alcoholic drinks available on a selfservice basis but it appeared a glass of fizz was available if you asked for it i saw it being carried out to people the big drawback about this lounge is that it doesnt have enough power points the only ones i could find were situated next to seats right round the l shaped lounge to the left also its not clear to passengers where the toilets are if you miss them on the way in loads of people are left wandering aimlessly around the computer area only to have walk back all the way round to the entryexit signs the coffee is still excellent from the machine  why its so foul onboard club europe is anyones guess my only other moan is that unless youre a frequent flyer from lgw its not clear how far the gate is from the lounge no map on the mobile app nor anything in the highlife magazine gate 54 appeared and i wasnt sure if i had to walk all the way over that irritating airbridge which adds another 10 minutes to your journey,15th November 2013,London Gatwick Airport,4
S Albury,has a very limited range of food and drink,this lounge has a very limited range of food and drink but this would be just about acceptable if there was somewhere to escape the relentless sax led funk background music dreadful,15th November 2013,Atlanta Hartsfield Airport,3
M Ackermans,the worst lounge that i have been in,this is the worst lounge that i have been in breakfast only sweet biscuits sweet croissants some sandwiches  early in the morning and once the food is gone it is gone so do yourself a favour and do not come to the le anfore lounge as it is not worth the trouble i would hate to think what they charged qantas for the orange juice and the coffee we had,6th October 2013,Rome Fiumicino Airport,3
Robert Donnelly,overall a disappointment even with a discount,overall a disappointment even with a discount because time blocks are sold based upon your departure time we were obliged to buy 3hours of access when we only needed two on the plus side the lounge is calm airy comfortable and has great views of the tarmac on the other hand staff were indifferent and insufficiently aware of the needs of the buffet station the food itself was barely okay selection and quality were narrow the hot dishes most certainly were not and i worried about that wine selection was also okay house selections were canadian brands was it worth $85cad+ no,6th October 2013,Toronto Pearson Airport,3
Les Young,found it to be very comfortable,we had a two hour wait in the lounge and found it to be very comfortable and the complimentary hot and cold food was excellent there was a complimentary bar as well free wifi and special areas for viewing tv programs and also working areas with desktop computers,6th October 2013,London Heathrow Airport,5
Tony McLaughlin,much improved from my last visit 3 years ago,much improved from my last visit 3 years ago wifi is available the bathrooms are in the lounge it is air conditioned it is bigger good selection of drinks although you have to ask the desk to replenish snacks only very good for a regional airport,6th October 2013,Toulouse Airport,3
Roger Tilling,a good selection of food and drinks on offer,the last time i visited the lgw ba terraces lounge it was on two floors  now there is only one entry was fast and there is a good selection of food and drinks on offer it was about midday and there was a full and extensive salad buffet with cold cuts there was also a selection of sandwiches the wide drinks selection is there but the sheer volume of passengers makes it like a january sale ba has removed a number of flights from gatwick and moved them to heathrow and halved the floor space of its lounge as a result however the remaining floor space isnt enough for the flights still operating from gatwick so expect crowds empty food trays no drink glasses and occupied showers rest assured that the sandwiches will never be stale  they are never available long enough to get that way,6th October 2013,London Gatwick Airport,3
D Burrows,superb level of service,superb level of service  attentive and friendly without being over the top excellent range of wine and other drinks very good food calm and relaxed atmosphere excellent washroom facilities,6th October 2013,London Heathrow Airport,5
T McLaughlin,comfortable and serene,much better than the north lounge ample breakfast food comfortable and serene recommended,6th October 2013,London Heathrow Airport,5
Alan Wan,only negative was painfully slow wifi,decent food on offer cheese cakes a curry mushroom soup and some thai titbits that were very tasty reasonable wine choice mainly australian including sparkling wine rather than champagne staff were very efficient at clearing plates there appeared to be plenty of showers although i didnt need to use them the only negative was painfully slow wifi i gave up trying i also tried to jal lounge it was more spacious but ba had better drink and marginally better food,6th October 2013,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,3
Nadia Ridout-Jamieson,ridiculously busy dirty and poor food,ridiculously busy dirty and poor food how did ba ever sink so much the north lounge at heathrow is now beyond the pale and the south lounge is not much better it is not a pleasant experience and compares unfavourably to the virgin lounge at heathrow by some distance its hard to find any privacy in these lounges the food at best is of average quality and i am unsurprised to read that the food standards agency has ordered improvements in basic hygiene levels in these lounges im afraid i too myself off to the eat cafe for coffee i felt the £175 i paid there was better value and certainly the coffee was better shame on you ba for the prices you charge you should treat your club class passengers with more respect,6th October 2013,London Heathrow Airport,3
A York,poor wifi lazy staff and pokey lounge,poor wifi lazy staff and pokey lounge front desk ran out of buffet tickets for business class diners and just generally feels badly organized i did a speed test on the wifi and it was <1 mbs lounge is shared with aa but really cant accommodate many people at all some nice armchairs in first area but otherwise cramped and uncomfortable i fly out out here often and its just not good enough for ba,15th September 2013,Philadelphia Airport,2
James Myers,all the staff were very nice and welcoming,i visited this lounge at the end of a wonderful trip to the niagara falls area for a family reunion flying in and out of toronto from london part of the enjoyment was travelling in business class club world and on the return trip i had several hours to enjoy the lounge before the night flight what made it special for me was the very kind and attentive manager all the staff were very nice and welcoming they are good ambassadors for ba,14th August 2013,Toronto Pearson Airport,5
D West,what a pleasant surprise,thought wed try the lounge as it was yards away from departure gate what a pleasant surprise quiet and peaceful and away from the crowds in the mail lounge i think its even better than first,31st July 2013,London Heathrow Airport,4
A Simon,found this lounge great for relaxing and unwinding,i found this lounge great for relaxing and unwinding as only british airways first class passengers are allowed in unless you have your 5000 frequent flier tier points to get a concorde room card all gold and silver card holders use the galleries lounges meaning this one is much more quiet and peaceful staff did a good job keeping the lounge clean but sometimes this meant that they took a bit too much time to fulfill passengers requests although they definetly did not outdo themselves in terms of the restroomshower quality they did a good job with it and i found each well kept business center had pretty fast internet and wifi worked well although the food options offered were all very tasty one thing i disliked about this lounge was that those options were pretty limited and other than a few main course choices there were only light snacks available upon request overall i think britsh airways took a good risk by not making this lounge extremely large and instea d putting their focus on the quality of the area and i would definetly visit again and recommend it to others,31st July 2013,London Heathrow Airport,5
A Simon,it doesn't open until 4pm for the evening flights,the only downside to this lounge is that it doesnt open until 4pm for the evening flights i am not sure if it is open in the morning for the morning flight out of jfk so if you have a long layover chances are you will have to spend some time in the galleries first and terraces lounges which are nice but dont touch the quality of this lounge a very tranquil and peaceful area british airways has made sure there are almost too many staff members so that while food is prepared the lounge is cleaned etc there are also staff available to help with anything you need when dinner is available the quality and choice of food is fantastic and there is a wide selection of snacks available upon request when in search of something lighter the wifi works well and there are also 3 computers in the back a small quiet room that could easily be missed provides a nice place to relax the only negative to this lounge is that the spashower rooms are not in the lou ge so to take a shower i had to walk across the terminal and into the business class lounge but its a small terminal so its not that bad overall this has to be one of my favorite lounges in the world and i actually prefer it over the concorde room at london heathrow,31st July 2013,New York JFK Airport,5
Alan Wan,surprised how good the lounge was,having visited the ba first lounges at jfk and lgw and being disappointed i was very surprised how good the lounge was lots of space and natural light and good food and drink choice the mrs and i had made to order food as well as helping ourselves to the hot buffet and cakes we felt very spoilt nice champagne only let down was the johnny walker blue available at lgw was missing,7th July 2013,London Heathrow Airport,4
B Wijesinghe,food service is merely average,31 may 2013 afternoon and evening usage due to a long layover the lounge space is quite nice and functions reasonably well despite lacking shower facilities the glass tube shaped terminal building offers nice tarmac views from this lounge the food service is merely average most of the day but the beverage service is quite good a dinner buffet was served much too late for the sleeper service flight ba does this to exclude the cx customers who share the lounge but it gives ba passengers only about an hour prior to boarding leaving very little time for flexibility lounge front counter staff members were outstanding and went out of their way to make me feel welcome overall one of the nicer ba lounges though not quite as well equipped as their lounges at lhr t5,7th July 2013,Dubai Airport,4
I Johnstone,very small lounge for the size of airport,very small lounge for the size of airport and became very busy toward departure time of mid afternoon flight very attentive reception staff food on offer at approximately 1400 hrs was fine sandwich selection pastries soup biscuits crisps nuts etc lounge staff cleared and cleaned up efficiently this lounge just needs to be extended as it is too small close to gates 10 +11 for the lhr flights and boarding calls made timely,7th July 2013,Edinburgh Airport,4
D Salter,clear up service of used plates and mugs somewhat slow,good welcome despite being busy plenty of seating  either for sitting at table to eat or just sitting great selection of food which was frequently refreshed clear up service of used plates and mugs somewhat slow great viewing of planes landing toilet facilities clean and sufficient,7th July 2013,London Heathrow Airport,5
P Donald,the food and service levels are dismal,the aesthetics of the lounge are very pleasing the food and service levels are dismal food is served under hot lamps but unfortunately they dont do their work food is cold attempting to speak to staff made no difference british airways are expensive customers who part with well earned cash deserve an above average experience this wasnt average it was dismal,7th July 2013,London Heathrow Airport,2
N White,quality and choice of the food has gone downhill,very poor the quality and choice of the food has gone downhill they must be on an economy drive or changed supplier as the difference has been very noticeable ba are falling behind in the premium class im writing this in the lounge on the worlds slowest internet connection too,7th July 2013,London Heathrow Airport,3
David Carter,huge disappointment with the concorde lounge,first time flying in first through t5 and huge disappointment with the concorde lounge  no dedicated security checks means you stand in a queue for 30 minutes lounge is small and cramped  staff poorly trained and clearly have no natural customer service flair restaurant booths were full when we were there  staff were unhelpful and no booking system meaning you need to go back over and again to find space in the end we went to the gordon ramsey opposite the lounge orders not fulfilled in the bar area or the terrace carpets stained and the whole room looking tired elmis spa has no dedicated area for first in fact we couldnt get in  as priority is first come rather than first then business overall dont use this lounge and t5 as any kind of reason to fly british airways,7th July 2013,London Heathrow Airport,2
Pat Marwick,very disappointed in the concorde room,very disappointed in the concorde room the dining staff seemed almost irritated that we wanted breakfast scrambled eggs were cold im still waiting for the second cup of coffee i requested very pleasant seating outside in the terrace area but so difficult to catch the attention of the staff i eventually went up to the bar myself but the one guy was busy filling orders for the waitresses and i had to wait to catch his attention i saw no food except for the food served in the dining area next time we will go to the galleries lounge and help ourselves,29th May 2013,London Heathrow Airport,4
J Rodder,the lounge offers a basic product,the ba lounge at warsaw airport is located after immigration control on the lower level a fairly quiet lounge with hot and cold drinks available but a poor selection of snacks crisps and nuts seem to make up bas choice of food in warsaw although a few stale bread rolls were available with cheese the lounge offers a basic product,29th May 2013,Warsaw Chopin Airport,3
J Henson,plenty of alcohol available,late morning flight to heathrow i found the lounge relatively easily warm welcome limited flight information in the lounge but flight was called in plenty of time 40 minutes prior and boarding had only just started when we arrived travelling to the gate g12 involved using a shuttletrain so it is worth giving yourself plenty of time lounge very spacious newspapers available but no english language magazines food limited but  too late for breakfast and too early for lunch catering consisted of crisps nuts fruit and a few pastries coffee machine broken beer on tap but another passenger commented that the barrel needed to be changed plenty of alcohol available including prosecco luggage storage space available toilets decent and within lounge,29th May 2013,Rome Fiumicino Airport,3
J Henson,very limited hot food available in this lounge,mid morning flight to rome a reasonably warm welcome at the front desk decent selection of newspapers and magazines the lounge was very busy and it was a struggle to find 2 seats in particular ones surrounded by used glasses plates and cups wifi was difficult to connect to although more the fault of myself and my ipad password readily displayed and there is a a guide in the lounge for ipad users champagne available on request and unusually freely available in the bar area selection of basic breakfast items juices and snacks there is very limited hot food available in this lounge toilets very clean,29th May 2013,London Gatwick Airport,3
Christopher Slater-Walker,it didn't seem too busy even on a friday evening,we had some difficulty finding this lounge; on our first attempt at following the vip signs we ended up at a different lounge where we could have stayed but we were advised that there was another lounge much closer to our gate which was in fact the case its a comfortable lounge and it didnt seem too busy even on a friday evening there are different types of seating including desks and tables as well as a lot of very comfortable armchairs there is a very nice rest area which is kept in semi darkness with beds where you can take a nap there are plenty of drinks available including wines spirits coffee and various soft drinks the food is a little disappointing consisting of a small range of sandwiches a fresh batch was delivered while we were there and they seemed quite freshly made and various other snacks nothing more substantial is available there seems to be no more than 15 minutes of free wifi available which is rather disappointing for a business lounge together with the poor signage towards the lounge and the obvious lack of airport staff in general for the first time visitor this lounge gets an average score from us if you know where it is already then you may find it better we did enjoy the chance to relax for a couple of hours before our departure though,16th April 2013,Barcelona Airport,4
H Pugh,lounge is a bit tired,the lounge is a bit tired and wifi access is via a password at the reception area in terms of refreshments the lounge has to be the worst i have ever experienced snacks were just about it and they were few and far between there was a large basket of biscuit for cheese but no cheese on offer when i enquired about this at reception i was curtly told “we offer sandwiches from 3pm thats it” i entered the lounge at 12:30pm some beer spirits and wine were available but not a great selection there are no toilets in the lounge so to go you have to take everything with you and its a trek,4th April 2013,Berlin Tegel Airport,2
B Johnston,what a disappointment. canteen style food,what a disappointment canteen style food food served in metal canteen holders were a fitting receptacle for clumps of penne pasta and tomato sauce cheese served in the same metal container chunks of cheddar and indifferent blue no wonder the majority were feasting on kettle chips as the only fresh oasis in a sea of processed food we were tempted to slip next door to the one where we knew we could order a fresh cooked snack before boarding but instead we are hopeful that the food on board may be better and therefore we will maintain our appetites shame on ba for not show casing the best of british fare when passengers are leaving the uk,8th March 2013,London Heathrow Airport,3
Mark McCutcheon,experienced appalling customer service,as a qantas club member my wife two young children and i were refused entry as our children were counted as guests a few days earlier we were allowed entry to the ba lounge in vancouver and we have never had problems with qantas lounges bas policy here is unfair to families travelling with kids to make matters worse i raised the issue with the manager and experienced appalling customer service bordering on vindictiveness,18th February 2013,London Heathrow Airport,4
A Twigg,you can easily find yourself in a nice corner,not very well signposted to the location of the lounge i just happened to look left at the correct time excellent lounge though reception is staffed is by informative and jolly staff as the lounge is only used by a handful of flights each day it is quiet and you can easily find yourself in a nice corner with a couple of tables and chairs to spread out full selection of wines spirits and beers were on offer with peroni on draft which is a great addition to any airline lounge hot drinks machine was working a good range of food was on offer with an assortment of finger sandwiches that werent dry or tasteless nice little pasta pots also added a twist to the offerings a good selection pastries in terms of comfort the seating was good the furnishings and little details gave it the signature british airways lounge feel lack of departures screen can make you slightly anxious that youll see your plane trundle past as you are fully reclined at one of the window seats but the receptionist insists she will call the flight for you but being british we need to see it to believe it  by using the free wifi in the lounge keeping an eye on your flights status is possible overall a fantastic terraces lounge outside of the uk much larger than required but not going to complain food on offer left me content and drinks on offer were of expected quality,14th February 2013,Rome Fiumicino Airport,5
Michael Miller,no problems finding a comfortable seat,visited this lounge on a late monday afternoon there were very few people in the lounge when we arrived so no problems finding a comfortable seat the choice of food was very limited and the same as every time we use this lounge the only hot option was soup which although very good surely should not be the only choice in the middle of winter other options were salads cold pasta dish and sandwiches which were beginning to curl at the edges the drinks available were as usual excellent with good wines good choice of spirits and non alcoholic beverages the staff were helpful and friendly the only thing that lets this premium lounge down is the uninspired food choice,4th February 2013,London Gatwick Airport,4
Chris White,no outside windows and quite small,theres almost nothing after customs except the ba lounge great range of drinks and wines cheese and biscuits and a small range of sandwiches and wraps no outside windows and quite small warm welcome comfortable seating,18th January 2013,Bermuda Airport,4
Roger Tilling,it is a quiet and spacious haven with various zones,its a trip up a few escalators at the end of the terminal 5 departure lounge once you are finally there it is a quiet and spacious haven with various zones  you can use the internet relax on a sofa or at a table there are various points for coffee and tea wines and spirits as well as a nice food area for me it was morning and there was a selection of bacon rolls other hot breakfast items yoghurt sliced fresh fruits and juices the washrooms were clean and shower facilites were also available there is a similar lounge close to security but that is planned mainly for domesticeuropean passengers the one at the far end of t5 is better,18th January 2013,London Heathrow Airport,5
J Henson,very welcoming staff on the front desk,visited the ba lounge galleries south lounge in t5a prior to a long haul flight to asia very welcoming staff on the front desk good selection of newspapers and magazines available decent wifi which permitted streaming the cinema area is a good place to relax basic but filling selection of hot food available including cous cous pasta and jacket potatoes with various fillings good selection of wines available attentive staff seemed to be working in the lounge and lounge was kept clean and tidy only minor criticism is that on my several recent visits to this lounge it has been very busy or seemingly near capacity with trouble getting a seat anywhere near the buffet area or the sofa area that overlooks the main concourse and the coffee is of vending machine standard otherwise this is a very good facility,3rd January 2013,London Heathrow Airport,5
Derek Salter,easy to find. pleasant welcome,easy to find pleasant welcome comfortable seating and good view of airport varied and tasteful food direct access from the lounge to the plane just what a lounge should be,22nd November 2012,San Francisco Airport,4
Kevin Tunnicliffe,crowded when we first went in the lounge,arrived at about 11am and the bacon and rolls were thankfully still available crowded when we first went in the lounge cleared toward midday bacon et al replaced by pastries and fruit,8th November 2012,London Heathrow Airport,4
Keith Williams,a spacious comfortable lounge,a spacious comfortable lounge but the selection of food available is no where near as good as that available in lhr t5 however much better than most us airport lounges,7th November 2012,Manchester Airport,2
K Tunnicliffe,the seating was tired and food was almost non existent,compared to other ba lounges in the uk and abroad this one really sucks the location is good as the lounge is circular overlooking the main airside lounge and with runway views the seating was tired and food was almost non existent we had a midmorning transatlantic flight with american booked through ba and there was no evidence of the bacon rolls and other delights we are used to in terminal 5 toilets were in poor condition and the staff were lacklustre to say the least,3rd September 2012,Manchester Airport,5
A Hickling,staff regularly walked around taking orders from passengers,used the concorde room in the run up to the olympics and the height of the school holidays but it wasnt over crowded i booked a cabana which has a day bed tv free telephone writing desk bathroom and the option to order room service the staff regularly walked around taking orders from passengers and were delivered efficiently and with a smile the lounge was also cleared of any glasses plates etc and was kept very tidy the spa treatment was also very good but you need to book in advance to be sure of a treatment the food choices were excellent for both lunch and dinner accompanied by a selection of vintage champagnes and fine wines,5th August 2012,London Heathrow Airport,4
S Lawrie,great breakfast excellent service,great breakfast excellent service however no massage slots available and sneered at for not booking in advance although never received any information or suggestion to do so was never required on previous flights tofrom ny was spoken to as though i was a complete idiot for not booking before arriving and this was 3 hours before my flight,5th August 2012,London Heathrow Airport,3
S Lawrie,very small with no privacy,very small with no privacy close to gate so you can sit and watch plane being loaded poor selection of food and drink some strange sandwich fillings so ended up with a bag of crisps wifi very slow toilets only had 2 cubicles to share with club lounge disappointing,5th August 2012,Vancouver Airport,4
T McLaughlin,bright airy great views,bright airy great views quite busy for 615 on sunday morning but i guess there were a lot of passengers having arrived fro the us far east and australia lots of seating and quite varied seating from armchairs to bar stools staff exceptionally friendly food ok but plentiful could do with a few more sockets for charging iphones etc overall a very good experience,18th June 2012,London Heathrow Airport,3
T McLaughlin,pleasant enough lounge,pleasant enough lounge separate area for those who want to watch tv not a great selection of drinks food adequate plenty of power points you dont get blinded by the sun in this lounge as you do in other areas of the airport including the walk to the lounge from security,18th June 2012,Paris CDG Airport,3
Alan Wan,the choice of drinks was reasonable,the first class lounge looks attractive and seemed classier than the club lounge next door the choice of drinks was reasonable with decent champagne but the quality of whiskey was rather low for a first class lounge i used the showers in the business class lounge next door it was okay but i have certainly had better experiences the real serious disappointment was the choice of food there were some cold sandwiches and packets of cheap cheese and a variety of crisps etc but nothing hot  a real let down,18th June 2012,New York JFK Airport,2
Derek Greenaway,the carpets looked pretty filthy,there appear to be two lounges at prague the crystal and another the citigold which is supposed to be the better option considering the rest of the airport which is spacious clean and serviceable the lounges were quite frankly awful we had travelled ba club europe and were given passes to the crystal lounge this offered a coffee machine and some nuts and limited seating we then tried the citigold as we have gold cards and this was not a lot better they offered a fridge with some rather dry rolls and an assortment of cold salad pasta in individual pots a plate of broken biscuits and solf drinks the carpets looked pretty filthy and i was quite glad to get out of there free wifi was available but we would probably have been better down at kfc in the main hall,21st May 2012,Prague Airport,5
Jim Reid,significantly better than some of the lounges in t5,an excellent lounge plenty space comfortable and with good food significantly better than some of the lounges in t5,21st May 2012,London Heathrow Airport,5
M Clarke,staff clear tables very quickly after passengers leave,design is good plenty of different areas and types of seating excellent selection of beverages and good selection of food although not outstanding staff clear tables very quickly after passengers leave and are very helpful a very comfortable experience overall  could possibly be improved by an area for sleeping,8th May 2012,London Heathrow Airport,5
A Hickling,a most enjoyable way to start a trip,i spent about 8 hours in the lounge complex at heathrow t5 and was impressed about the constant changes of food throughout the day i used the north south and satellite lounges and they had variations on the menus the north and satellite lounges do have manned cloakrooms to store belongings whereas the south lounge you leave items at your own risk the lounges were kept clean and tidy despite the constant churn of passenger use if you are looking for peace and quiet the satellite terminal is the quietest and if you require champagne it is upon request shower and bathroom facilities were also very good and kept clean wifi is free and plenty of computers to use a most enjoyable way to start a trip,2nd May 2012,London Heathrow Airport,3
J Wyatt,usual fare - nosh a bit ordinary,in the north wing of t5 it is huge although on a sunday morning plenty of the seat were occupied usual fare  nosh a bit ordinary seat soso on comfort all a bit so so really,1st May 2012,London Heathrow Airport,3
Kevin Tunnicliffe,seating was comfortable and staff were efficient and very helpful,i was travelling on the daily ba flight to london we hit the lounge fairly early and there was nothing much to show in the way of snacks etc in a conspiratorial voice we were told to tell the bar staff that we were flying with ba and so would not be charged for drinks and so forth the prices for aa passengers were ridiculous we were also told that hot food would be available when the last aa flight departed this proved to be soup and a tray of sandwiches some crudities and a dip seating was comfortable and staff were efficient and very helpful good views of the runway and ramps from the bar area there were no showers and the bathrooms were not very modern and the fittings were in need of a makeover,1st May 2012,San Diego Airport,4
J Kearney,good food and beverage range with attentive staff,this is a rabbit warren to get around in reasonable to navigate around if you have a sense of direction and you can get your bearings good food and beverage range with attentive staff definitely no comparison to qantas first lounge at sydney international but i imagine there arent too many that would,24th April 2012,Miami Airport,4
J Kearney,the first class lounge was okay but not great,when you present your first class boarding passes to the first reception desk and are told you need to go over there club world lounge and you have to point out that you are a first class passenger things do not bode well the lounge is okay but champagne bar doesnt keep the champagne chilled adequately first class dining room has quite a limited menu and isnt great 6 months ago when i travelled first class out of london we were invited to experience the dining room and presented an invitation to dine after a certain time this practice has now gone  pity in fact the hot self serve buffet had a better food choice than the dining area overall the first class lounge was okay but not great,24th April 2012,London Heathrow Airport,2
J Kearney,encouraged to enter and relax,we arrived at the lounge to be greeted by 4 friendly staff and encouraged to enter and relax when we entered there were the best part of 150 people in it we struggled to get the last two seats we found out that they had closed the business class lounge and put everyone into the first class lounge just to make us feel special i guess uncomfortable seating self serve basic buffet poor food and beverage to say the least when we encountered a delay the staff were hopeless either inexperienced or incorrectly trained they could not cope or handle high yield passengers appropriately or properly choose another airport to transit with a better first class lounge,24th April 2012,Singapore Changi Airport,4
J Kearney,bright refreshing and well equipped,this is probably the best business class lounge that i have experienced bright refreshing and well equipped spacious and well fitted out enjoyable,24th April 2012,London Heathrow Airport,5
R Moore,excellent lounge with plenty of everything,excellent lounge with plenty of everything used it twice recently and it was quiet wellstocked with drinks food and papers and with plenty of room highly recommended,28th February 2012,London Heathrow Airport,5
N Werner,welcome was friendly and staff attentive,british airways share the qantas lounge located near the gates which is nice welcome was friendly and staff attentive food selection is much better than in lhr and nice interesting choices lounge is quite spacious even though both ba flights and a qantas flight were leaving at the same time there are no views as the lounge is not near the windows of the airport showers are nice great water pressure and they use nice toiletries staff friendly and gave a small amenity kit wifi was strong and quick and the lounge was a serene place to relax,27th February 2012,Hong Kong Airport,5
A Hickling,a quiet and relaxed lounge,a quiet and relaxed lounge with comfortable seating and superb views of the runways there are facilities to leave bags and coats and private dining booths for breakfast and lunch food and drink is waiter service although afternoon tea does not feature on any menu the staff were more than happy to serve this for me i used one of the cabanas where you have a day bed desk tv phone for free use and luxury bathroom facilities you can order room service from your cabana the elemis spa is located just outside the lounge but book a treatment early to avoid disappointment for me using this lounge is part of my holiday before a long haul flight,24th January 2012,London Heathrow Airport,4
Bill Atkins,this was an exceptionally nice lounge,this was an exceptionally nice lounge albeit small for 2 flights departing close together for the next year plus it is also to serve as the admirals club for aa needless to say it has gone from a little haven of peace to a typical us lounge facility british airways passengers and the staff clearly hate the situation,28th November 2011,Philadelphia Airport,4
Kevin Tunnicliffe,a variety of seating options,this lounge shared between ba iberia and american was spacious but laid out in a series of small rooms with a variety of seating options on the day we were there it was not overcrowded a good selection of drinks available the attended counter being closed food was pretty poor with only a few stale looking croissant sandwiches and soup on offer the flight announcements were barely audible where we were seated and i had to go and check with the reception that it had indeed been our flight which had been called wifi and computer availability were good unfortunately the arrivals and departure screens only dealt with aa flights,28th November 2011,Miami Airport,4
B Wijesinghe,spacious lounge with comfortable and quiet seating areas,spacious lounge with comfortable and quiet seating areas the selection of food and beverage is excellent though service when ordering from the menu is slow many computer terminals and helpful staff at the inner customer service desk the decorative glass screens between seating areas are lovely when lit if dark outside the lounge location benefits from nice views of the tarmac and taxiways the showers and elemis health spa are located outside the lounge and shared with the galleries business class lounge that is located above,22nd October 2011,London Heathrow Airport,1
J Samuels,the most miserable business lounge on this planet,without a doubt the most miserable business lounge on this planet having travelled from london and using the fantastic ba lounge i had the misfortune to land in la and through a reciprocal arrangement with ba i used the american airlines admirals club lounge its a joke  you pay for almost everything the only free stuff consists of things like lukewarm and stewed instant coffee stale biscuits and a few bruised pieces of fruit you get one drink voucher and no wifi access unless you are a member suggest you give this place and american airlines a wide berth unfortunately my next leg is with american airlines and no surprises you have to pay for in flight coffee and food i will never fly with budget airline american airlines again,21st October 2011,Los Angeles LAX Airport,3
R Beagley,i was frankly very disappointed,i was frankly very disappointed only half of the food on the bar menu was available and someone did tell me about other food options that were apparently available but they mumbled so much i have no clue as to what they said  at the third time of asking i gave up,21st October 2011,London Heathrow Airport,3
C Adams,was extremely crowded with almost all the seats taken,at the bag drop in terminal 5 the british airways staff member let me know that the galleries north lounge would be much closer to my flights departure gate than the south lounge i had not used the north lounge before and went along there assuming it would be the same as the south lounge in fact it was much less enjoyable the north lounge is significantly smaller and was extremely crowded with almost all the seats taken it was noisy hot and felt congested with passengers carryon bags filling the walkspace the food selection was similar to the south lounge but the range of magazines available was very limited next time i will know to go straight to the south lounge whichever gate my flight leaves from and just leave the extra time to walk up to the gates at the north of the terminal,17th September 2011,London Heathrow Airport,4
Ian Ford,the staff are friendly and efficient,fairly large lounge visited on a sunday evening standard terraces comfortable recently updated free wifi the staff are friendly and efficient at clearing tables and ensuring the limited offerings are kept up to date only one red and one white wine small selection of spirits and the food is only light snacks but what there is is of a good quality nice tartlets mini sandwiches etc overall a good experience it is a nice place to wait for a flight,13th September 2011,Geneva Airport,4
A Hickling,very comfortable and plenty of space,this is a newly refurbished lounge modelled on the concorde room at lhr very comfortable and plenty of space as this lounge is for exclusive use of ba passengers only travelling in first the food and beverages were of high quality and a dining area if you wished to use it the wifi was a bit slow so gave up in the end the spa facilities are upstairs in the terraces lounge and so are shower facilities,31st July 2011,New York JFK Airport,5
A Hickling,plenty of high quality and comfortable seating,a great lounge with plenty of high quality and comfortable seating the dining options are extensive and there is also an extensive range of drinks to choose from the private cabanas are good to use as you have more seclusion from the rest of the lounge and have your own bathroom day bed tv writing desk and you can order room service too there is also a telephone in the room where you can phone for free anywhere in the world the boardroom has free computers and a printer and the seats are original concorde chairs there are secure storage facilities for your belongings and clean bathroom facilities,31st July 2011,London Heathrow Airport,3
Greg Bell,windows are blocked off,the only hot food available were plastic containers of twominute noodles alcohol is served from a bar which is not always tended  you have to ring a bell and wait the only other food is packets of crisps crackers cheese the windows are blocked off by translucent blinds making it rather claustrophobic,18th July 2011,Seattle Airport,3
Bill Atkins,concorde room really has lost its exclusive feel,the concorde room really has lost its exclusive feel it was very crowded and from the destinations people were travelling too full of passengers not travelling in first  it is supposed to be only for first passengers according to the ba hype the staff spent much time discussing their work issues loudly in full hearing of the passengers staff do not actively patrol to see if anyone needs anything which is odd since nothing on offer is available selfservice food service was ok but not very professional and the presentation on the plate would be fine for a transport caff the whole deal falls short of what one expects of true first class service but of course that is typical of the whole experience on ba,4th July 2011,London Heathrow Airport,5
A Gibson,the view is spectacular,the sydney qantas first lounge could quite possibly be the best first class lounge on the planet great menu premium restaurant style food cooked to order and service excellent drink menu and the spa are something else if your into aviation and like seeing the air field activity and the planes coming and going the view is spectacular staff very attentive and the meals papers and internet service excellent ive travelled a bit first class and this lounge is the new standard five star comfort didnt really want to get on the plane,4th July 2011,Sydney Airport,2
A Edmonds,how can they call this first class i don't know,the first class lounge in houston is pathetic no showers and no food whatsoever except crisps and pre packed biscuits also no champagne how can they call this first class i dont know business class lounge is better as they did have a few rather dried up sandwiches,13th June 2011,Houston Hobby Airport,4
R Lubbers,rather small and feels a bit cramped,not much in the way of sandwiches or snacks on display but there were some cookies and a modest bar selection the preflight dinner in a private dining area across the hall actually in the business lounge was excellent with a nice salad and wellprepared entree and a choice of excellent dessert nice choice of wines as well the first lounge itself is actually rather small and feels a bit cramped  very pleasant staff however who let us know that our flight was boarding and were apologetic about the halfhour delay,3rd May 2011,Chicago O'Hare Airport,5
R Lubbers,huge lounge lots of people but no sense of being crowded,huge lounge lots of people but no sense of being crowded superb selection of liquor including grey goose and other premium brands nice wine selection as well fairly extensive selection of snacks of all kinds  some of the sandwiches were superb huge area with many computer work stations with good high speed internet service,3rd May 2011,London Heathrow Airport,4
Gregory Kohll,food selection was disappointing,lounge operated by qantas quieter than business class lounge but the food selection was disappointing especially compared to cathay pacific wireless access was provided by the airport and it was difficult to connect i dont think this lounge matches the standards of the first class lounges operated by cathay pacific and british airways,1st May 2011,Hong Kong Airport,4
A Hickling,menu choices were uninspiring and no afternoon tea served,although this lounge is modelled on the first galleries at t5 it does not live up the service and quality of the concorde room however it is a quieter lounge as the ba flights departing from here leave late in the evening so its not an issue to book a spa treatment the menu choices were uninspiring and no afternoon tea served preflight dining however was much better,14th February 2011,London Heathrow Airport,5
Alan Mackenzie,super for relaxing or working,t5 galleries super for relaxing or working well designed seating areas newspapers & magazines in various locations internet computers fax and copiers choice of snacks and well stocked bars the staff are unobtrusive but on hand if you require assistance,20th December 2010,London Heathrow Airport,5
Tim Barrs,lounge was spotless and i was greeted warmly,the lounge was spotless and i was greeted warmly by the man behind the desk even though i wasnt travelling with ba and had entered the lounge via priority pass the toilets were clean bar soft drinks and food was all well stocked and the papers and magazines were all current theres a tv and a monitor displaying flight times the man in the lounge was so helpful he even let us know when our non ba flight was boarding,20th November 2010,Jersey Airport,5
Fabrizio Ferraro,selection of hot food remains poor,i went back to this lounge and was surprised to find that they are transforming the outdated terraces lounge into a new galleries lounge similar to ones at heathrow airport the selection of hot food remains poor with only soup available but there was the same selection of cold food and drinks the lounge was extremely busy but there was enough room,1st September 2010,London Gatwick Airport,5
John Beattie,wandered in to a haven of peace and quiet,once passed security there are two lounges tip provided to me by the reception was use the lounge by gate30 as it has only 9% occupancy took the advice and wandered in to a haven of peace and quiet the fooddrink selection was good staff were polite and helpful where required,28th August 2010,London Heathrow Airport,3
Tony McLaughlin,well staffed and stocked,very small lounge but well staffed and stocked there was no aircon however which made it very uncomfortable on a day when it soared to 36 celsius mobile phones must be switched off ricard was the only spirit on offer,28th August 2010,Toulouse Airport,4
J Leahy,staff friendly and flights are called,small but very well set lounge with wine bar and eating area business area in far corner staff friendly and flights are called no signs of cut backs,13th August 2010,Athens Airport,3
K Tunnicliffe,comfortable and well supplied,this lounge has no windows it comprises three or four box like rooms including the dining room the lounge is comfortable and well supplied with drinks and biscuits the selection of sandwiches was poor two choices plus a wrap of some sort the pre flight dinner which ba offers for overnight flights to london was cold or lukewarm hardly surprising when the chef spent most of his time on the internet in the business section of the lounge instead of in the kitchen the exception was the excellent sweetcorn chowder of which i had two bowls as the rest of the food was stale and uninviting not a patch on the preflight dinner i enjoyed a couple of years ago at jfk i dont know if this is yet another sign of the diminishing standards with ba or just a lazy chef no showers either the rest of the staff were very helpful and gave good service,6th August 2010,Chicago O'Hare Airport,5
E McCaffery,calm environment in which to relax prepost flight,calm environment in which to relax prepost flight tastefully decorated and plenty of quiet spaces where it is possible to gain some privacy from others good cabanas to refresh and catch up on some sleep between flights full dining facilities enable one to get maximum sleep on board if overnight flight plenty of decent champagne too a proper first class facility if only this could be transposed onboard,3rd July 2010,London Heathrow Airport,4
E McCaffery,large and airy lounge,large and airy lounge with plenty space which is needed at busier times as gets fairly congested good selection papers magazines etc food readily available and plenty of it well cooked too and replenish regularly at busy times good selection of alcoholicnon alcoholic drinks too,3rd July 2010,London Heathrow Airport,2
E McCaffery,poor selection of drinks and lacklustre service,worse than any other lounge ever experienced regardless of class of travel to be fair airport undergoing renovations at time but that did not excuse the poor quality and availability of decent edible food poor selection of drinks and lacklustre service worst of all the air conditioning was not working and felt like being in a sauna for an hour before flight took off avoid like the plague,3rd July 2010,Los Angeles LAX Airport,4
Ian Henderson,pleasant helpful staff,one of a group of lounges in terminal d all operated by one company but with separate identities and side by side pleasant helpful staff and plenty of drinks and nibbles the concierge announced that new sandwiches had arrived first lounge is off the business just one male and one female loo and a small business centre plenty of newspapers compared with the nearby admirals club an oasis of calm and style,2nd July 2010,,4
Fabrizio Ferraro,the downside is the lack of natural light,this galleries lounge is very similar to the ones in t5 although it is much smaller they have the same choice of food and drinks and similar facilities it is extremely quite due to the small number of ba flights out of t3 and the downside is the lack of natural light the windows are quite narrow and the lack of atmosphere even the ba staff looked bored and not very welcoming,1st May 2010,London Heathrow Airport,5
Paul Browne,a lot of room to move around,very impressive from the welcome at the door to every member of the staff encountered lovely ambience with a lot of room to move around took lunch in the dining room which was the only disappointment,1st May 2010,London Heathrow Airport,3
Tim New,lounge a bit old and worn now,the best thing about the ba lounge at newcastle is the staff i fly every week so have got to know them and they are always professional and courteous lounge a bit old and worn now but don’t expect ba will upgrade they only seem to be in the business of downgrading everything these days good selection of drinks sandwiches at lunchtimes nice freshly prepared and a good selection a nice place to wait for an hour or a bit longer the staff are the same two or three very pleasant ladies – wish ba would commission them to train their fa colleagues in customer centricity one negative  just one loo and it has never flushed properly since my two years using it,9th April 2010,Newcastle Airport,4
E Hochstatter,lounge is rather soulless and lacking in comfort and style,the lounge in terminal 5 at stockholmarlanda is very basic it is shared with other oneworld partners and i believe is part of the priority pass network the lounge is rather soulless and lacking in comfort and style there are just mediumsized seats spread out over the lounge the food was basic and mediocre consisting mainly of cheese and ham bread rolls and what appeared to be a quinoa salad the standard fizzy drinks on offer curiously red and whte wine was available but in a beerlike pouring mechanism in short there is no need to get to the airport early to enjoy this lounge because there is not much to enjoy unlike other ba lounges,9th April 2010,Stockholm Vasteras Airport,3
A Evans,pleasant small lounge with reasonably comfortable seating,pleasant small lounge with reasonably comfortable seating good views of stands and an open area outside originally used for us smokers but now banned shame no hot food but fresh sandwiches and cakes an adequate selection of drinks as there is only one flight a day i was surprised there were not more people,9th April 2010,Sao Paulo Guarulhos Airport,4

R King,an amazing kids room,very quiet in the middle of the day  we had 7 hours to wait between flights with our 2 year old daughter  an amazing kids room in the lounge with soundproof glass walls you can sit outside and relax and watch the kids inside very good idea great selection of french and european wine great nibbles only downside  coffee machine made terrible coffee and the restaurant did not open for the entire 7 hours we were there not enough clients still had the snack menu but no sit down fine dining as advertised at 630pm it had still not opened for dinner and after asking and getting no response we left to catch our flight i am still confused as to what was going on here free pcs with internet too,9th April 2010,,4
Steve Ham,new lounge looks good,new lounge looks good and is for ba use only selection of hot and cold food which was very tasty and well presented we were on the day flight with using the 777 so lounge was very quiet would presume it would be busy for the evening 747 flight,3rd April 2010,Mumbai Airport,2
J Muga,lounge is comfortable enough,lounge is comfortable enough using the same furniture as the new lounges at heathrow t5 the problem is mosquitos that have come in not a fewbut a massive amount the catering is poor old fruitcake stale cheese and a few indian dishes guaranteed to give stomach problems  nobody touched them yet they have four attendants standing around doing nothing  why spend all the money for a new lounge,9th February 2010,Mumbai Airport,3
J Aberg,capacity is a big problem,this lounge is a rather standard ba lounge but it does have some major flaws capacity is a big problem in this lounge i have rarely been in a lounge of this size where i have not not been able to find any seating whatsoever the lounge was absolutely packed it was so full that i decided to leave after a while because it was not worth the effort to find some personal space in the lounge i wanted to go online but apart from two free computers wireless was at a charge i paid quite a hefty charge and i had major problems trying to connect i could only spend five minutes online and i was constantly disconnected in summary there is significant room for improvement,3rd February 2010,Cape Town Airport,4
L Haas,not crowded and plenty of food,i visited one lounge in the main part of t5 only to see a boarding now sign for my flight which was not departing for nearly 2 hours it turns out they were trying to get people to the t5b satellite because of enhanced security procedures i made my way over to t5b and used the lounge there  not crowded and plenty of food good wifi access free computers to use all in all a pleasant quiet place to spend time before flight one negative for ba: when i arrived at heathrow a week previously  the arrivals lounge at t5 had already closed promptly at 2pm this seems very early given that the 2nd schedule sfolhr flight arrives at 2 pm,23rd January 2010,London Heathrow Airport,1
Andre Le Quesne,dirty crockery was strewn across the tables,one would have thought that british airwaysjersey would have taken notice of r pembertons review of this lounge  12 august 2009 absolutely nothing has changed  for the better that is at the time of my visit late afternoon dirty crockery was strewn across the tables the elderly male attendant did not even bother to look up when i entered so no check of my credentials and certainly not greeting it may be that ba jersey are trying to save on electricity but i could not find any other reason for all the ceiling lights being switched off there are table lamps but it was difficult to read the dogeared newspapers on the shelves carpets and upholstery are still filthy so no change there i used the newly built lavatory which appeared not to have been cleaned that day i live in jersey and this is my local airport what sort of impression does this hellhole make on departing passengers,12th January 2010,Jersey Airport,2
Clive Drake,an insult to every ba club world customer,the recent experience of the ba terraces lounge at gatwick was one of total shock  since my last visit in october 50% of the facility has been closed  what was on two floors providing a very good experience  is now an insult to every ba club world customer  as it is now located on 1 floor passengers cannot find seats due to overcrowding  and me and my family of 4 had to half stand and half sit as we ate our snack breakfast bas cost cutting has reached a new and deeply insulting low in the way it treats its premium customers  thankful i am flying with another airline this month to new zealand,8th January 2010,London Gatwick Airport,2
J Keddy,a very cold and dull lounge,this is a very cold and dull lounge the staff are far from welcoming  its as if you have ruined their day just by being there as someone else mentioned there is evidence of cost cutting throughout  fine for those in economy but not what one expects after paying so much more for a business class experience the refreshments on offer were pathetic i was there for an early morning flight and there were baskets of mini croissants and pan au chocolat cereal toast and coffeejuices etc 100% selfservice miserable staff hanging around like vultures ready to clear your table before you have finished swallowing your last mouthful you can go out to the duty free shops but they dont bother to offer to look after your bags and coats so you need to lug them around with you if you are carrying anything of value which i usually am laptop etc,7th January 2010,London Gatwick Airport,4
A Excel,lounge was small very limited food,arrived at suvarnabhumi airport a little early in order to check out baqf first class lounge very disappointed nothing special  if anything the business class lounge opposite was as good if not better the first lounge was small very limited food  cheese platter 2 choices two types of rolls and wraps only difference between business and first was choice of wines and champagne,31st December 2009,Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport,2
Paul Donovan,old fashioned with a poor selection of food,the lounge in miami needs a total refurbishment its old fashioned with a poor selection of food a real let down,24th December 2009,Miami Airport,2
John Robinson,not worth the extra cost in my opinion,not worth the extra cost in my opinion the lounge was busy  it was difficult to get a seat the breakfast was paltry  tiny croissants for instance there was no sense of luxury  an air of convenience and costeffectiveness staff were not particularly polite,20th December 2009,London Heathrow Airport,5
Bill Atkins,the staff however are exemplary,though this lounge is very new it really is not big enough to handle the 2 flights which leave quite close together in the evening the staff however are exemplary  very welcoming professional and friendly with a real sense of enjoying their interaction with the passengers there is a good selection of food and drinks with very acceptable preflight dining if only the t5 lounges were the same as this one,20th December 2009,Philadelphia Airport,3
G Simpson,shocked is all i can say,shocked is all i can say after trying the concorde lounge earlier in the year the terraces was a huge let down we got to the airport 4 hours before the flight yet told the spa was full the food was mediocre we had to ask for champagne it was comfortable enough and the wifi was good,8th December 2009,London Heathrow Airport,2
Clive Drake,everything felt like a 60s time warp,as a gold card member i could use this lounge unlike heathrows concorde lounge which is exclusive for 1st passengers as i awaited my flight to antigua carpet very worn and dull as was most of the chairs and seating; everything felt like a 60s time warp foodbreakfast was ok  nothing to speak about coffee machine appeared to be the only thing different to the club terraces option disappointing,4th December 2009,London Gatwick Airport,3
D Wright,the attentive staff that makes this lounge a real pleasure,its the attentive staff that makes this lounge a real pleasure staff members have always gone the extra mile to deal with seating upgrade and flight change and other special requests efficiency and smiles are a great combination food and drink are average but adequate too bad the washrooms are outside the lounge,4th December 2009,Berlin Tegel Airport,3
Fabrizio Ferraro,might find it difficult to find a seat,this lounge is shared by ba and qantas and doesnt have many seats so unless you get there quite early you might find it difficult to find a seat the seats are old and need a make over the choice of drinks is limited only one red one white and one sparkling wine not champagne the choice of food was limited to nuts fruit cold finger sandwiches cheese and crackers and asian snacks very tasty okay selections of newspapers no tv screens and a limited number of it stations with one out of order the lavatories were clean and so were the shower rooms,4th December 2009,Hong Kong Airport,1
Clive Drake,if you travel to antigua and miss it don't worry about it,there is a daily flight tofrom gatwick from antigua and it is a disgrace that ba use this shoddy shared lounge  landside at antigua vc bird airport its like a tomb  windows are shuttered and those not  look into a large waiting area that never seems to be used an array of snacks are left on the sideboard  a bit of cheese and raw vegetables  drinks are served by a waiter dire  if you travel to antigua and miss it dont worry about it,4th December 2009,Antigua Vc Bird Airport,4
F Ferraro,lounge is very clean and the staff friendly and welcoming,the ba lounge in mxp is an old style terrace lounge the lounge is very clean and the staff friendly and welcoming the food served is quite good all italian style focaccia sandwiches small pizzas etc the choice of drinks is good with lots of typical italian drinks available good selection of newspapers and a few it stations although only one was working properly there was also a smoking room available dirty plates and glasses were cleared continuously,7th September 2009,Milan Malpensa Airport,3
Martin Brown,pleasantly surprised with plenty of seating available,this is a shared lounge used by several airlines  pleasantly surprised with plenty of seating available lounge looks modern with lots of natural daylight spacious clean on one side is quite a large bar no self service for coffee tea etc you go to the bar and have your drink prepared for you  i think this gives a more personal service on the bar is a menu listing available sandwiches around the lounge were monitors displaying flight information and announcements were made frequently about boarding or gate changes which is in contrast to heathrow t5 where there are no announcements i prefer announcements as you dont need to keep getting up near reception is a smoking room with a television displaying the news the smoking room was as comfortable as the main lounge and was just as clean with staff clearing cups and plates regularly across the entire lounge a magazine rack was located near the entrance with daily newspapers and magazines in russian ukrainian and english but staff werent clearing left newspapers often when my flight was called the gate was literally 30 feet away this lounge certainly was a relaxing retreat away from the crowds and i wish more were like this,6th September 2009,Kiev Borispol Airport,2
J Maclean,you will struggle to find a comfortable seat,this is easily the poorest of all the ba 1st class lounges i have frequented it is a reasonably large space which fills up very rapidly within a few hours of the 2 to 3 late night flights back to london very often you will struggle to find a comfortable seat i no longer eat anything in this lounge as the quality of the catering is not up to scratch you will hardly ever find a uk newspaper unless you are 34 hours early and i cant think of a single redeeming feature of this lounge  not even a good view it is well overdue a complete refurbishment and the general decor is grubby and tatty singapore  london is a very busy route for ba and presumably therefore somewhat profitable if you travel the same route with singapore airlines the lounges are far superior as is the general lounge service,1st September 2009,Singapore Changi Airport,4
F Ferraro,found the lounge very comfortable,i found the lounge very comfortable enough space for everyone although it was a friday before a bank holiday weekend the choice of hot food is limited but appropriate used plates and glasses are promptly removed by the staff who are polite and assist requests promptly i didnt use the showers but the elemis receptionist went out of her way and gave me her unused personal elemis lip saver although these products were not generally available to passengers ba should improve the magazines selection,30th August 2009,London Heathrow Airport,5
Gordon Wallace,very nice large and spacious,the new club lounge at t3 is very nice large and spacious with different seating areas there was a large selection of both hot and cold food the red and white wines are in different seating areas which is slightly strange and champagne is only available if you ask the staff were attentive and customer service could not be faulted,14th August 2009,London Heathrow Airport,3
John Maley,staff friendly and helpful,this is the new improved lounge and is for those entitled to first class privileges but not travelling first class i was travelling domestically so this was why i used this lounge seriously this is the best ba can come up with after how many years i asked for the restaurant and was shown the buffet the lounge was nice even allowing for the fact that it was hot in some areas and cool in others showers were basic staff friendly and helpful not worth the effort to try it out,12th August 2009,London Heathrow Airport,4
L Hughes,great improvement on the old lounge,great improvement on the old lounge quite small but well appointed the first restaurant excellent  although we were the only two customers  with service both efficient and attentive bit of a walk to get there from the underpass walkway however although if youre not in a desperate hurry its no real problem as usual this comes at the end of a mass of confusion and waiting for security even in the premium queue,12th August 2009,Washington Dulles Airport,4
Bill Atkins,service can be inconsistent,had a longish layover due to ba delay and resulting rebooking so decided to use one of the cabanas these are hotelstyle rooms with day bed tv and music and a private bath had champagne and lunch delivered to the room so very nice then i discovered that the room only had one temperature  freezing cold also the rooms back up to what may be a kitchen with constant banging of doors and other loud noises not very much chance of getting a rest here finally moved out into the lounge proper which is already showing some signs of wear and struggles to accomodate everyone at busy times restaurant food choices are rather uninspired and presentation not of the highest standard service can be inconsistent for an exclusively first class lounge this could be better,11th August 2009,London Heathrow Airport,1
James Pemberton,it had deteriorated even further,i recently read a review on this website regarding the terrace lounge facilities at jersey airport and was shocked to find it had deteriorated even further from the original submission food and dirty plates had been left out for many hours stained carpets and a poorly stocked bar compounded by a member of staff deciding to leave the lounge at 8 pm half an hour before the last flight was due to depart passengers had no idea it had incurred a delay and our only source of information came from data streams located on tv’s 100m away from the lounge simply terrible british airways i would recommend that anyone flying business class from jersey attempts to spend as much time away from the lounge as you will only be disappointed with the service,11th August 2009,Jersey Airport,4
Fabrizio Ferraro,food selection is simple,club europe lounge at gatwick is very nice it is on two floors and very spacious the food selection is simple only sandwiches pasta salads and similar and cheese with biscuits plus the usual snacks the only hot food served is soup very good selection of drinks with champagne on request very good selection of newspapers and magazines it workstations worked very well and are very modern the toilet facilities are good with excellent showers and you can ask for elemis products the only downside was the lack of atmosphere the lounge is very quite and with no music played in the background it could have been very boring,30th July 2009,London Gatwick Airport,4
Simon Taylor,good atmosphere,small but fine for the number of travellers on the day good atmosphere standard of food and drink good but range limited in comparison to say galleries so scores down a little,30th July 2009,Montréal Airport,1
John Wilson,decor is drab,only food available was cheese and crackers a waitress eventually appeared but did not approach anyone  she had to be asked for drinks she brought them through and was never seen again the room is fully enclosed and looks out on the seating area in the departure lounge  before security the decor is drab a few magazines to read as well as some out of date newspapers couldnt wait to get on the plane shame as it soured the end of our holiday slightly,15th July 2009,Antigua Vc Bird Airport,4
Ian Henderson,pleasant and efficient staff,pretty busy lounge with good wifi and announcement when new uk newspapers arrived alcoholic drinks only available through a servery with occasional missing staff and therefore short queues and delays pleasant and efficient staff,13th July 2009,Seattle Airport,
